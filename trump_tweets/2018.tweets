HAPPY NEW YEAR !
… Senator Schumer, more than a year longer than any other Administration in history .  These are people who have been approved by committees and all others, yet Schumer continues to hold them back from serving their Country !  Very Unfair !
Heads of countries are calling wanting to know why Senator Schumer is not approving their otherwise approved Ambassadors !  ?  Likewise in Government lawyers and others are being delayed at a record pace !  360 great and hardworking people are waiting for approval from …
It's incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn't work .  It does, and properly built, almost 100% !  They say it's old technology - but so is the wheel .  They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying !
I'm in the Oval Office .  Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall .  You voted yes in 2006 and 2013 .  One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast !
I'm in the Oval Office .  Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall .  You voted yes in 2006 and 3013 .  One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast !
I am the only person in America who could say that, I'm bringing our great troops back home, with victory, and get BAD press .  It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining .  If I stayed in Endless Wars forever, they would still be unhappy !
I campaigned on Border Security, which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall .  Our Southern Border has long been an Open Wound, where drugs, criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country .  Dems should get back here an fix now !
… Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be !  I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS, remember !
… I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places .  Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working .  Just doing what I said I was going to do !
If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero .  ISIS is mostly gone, we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants …
An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED, as has been reported by the media .  Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through (thereby making it possible to see what is happening on both sides) .  Makes sense to me !
President and Mrs .  Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their  DC  mansion/compound .  I agree, totally necessary for their safety and security .  The  US  needs the same thing, slightly larger version !
Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown .  No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans !
Veterans on President Trump's handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating .  On being a strong leader - 59% .   AP Poll .  Thank you !
It turns out to be true now, that the Department of Justice and the FBI, under President Obama, rigged the investigation for Hillary and really turned the screws on Trump, and now it looks like in a corrupt & illegal way .  The facts are out now .  Whole Hoax exposed .  @JesseBWatters
Absolutely nothing (on Russian Collusion) .  Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal .  The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics .  The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats !
2018 is being called THE YEAR OF THE WORKER by Steve Moore, co-author of Trumponomics .  It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the best job market in 50 years, and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers .  Big wage gains .
For those that naively ask why didn't the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us NONE for Border Security !  Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown .  Too bad !  @FoxNews
… children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol .  The father of the young girl said it was not their fault, he hadn't given her water in days .  Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end .  They are working so hard & getting so little credit !
Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally .  They can't .  If we had a Wall, they wouldn't even try !  The two …
Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China .  Deal is moving along very well .  If made, it will be very comprehensive, covering all subjects, areas and points of dispute .  Big progress being made !
I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security .  From what I hear, they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military !
The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19,000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover, Agent Peter S .  These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax .  This is a total Obstruction of Justice .  All Texts Demanded !
Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany .  Great things are happening !
… Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money .  Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it .  We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of  US  for years !
… close the Southern Border .  Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs .  Go back to pre-NAFTA, before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico .  Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border …
… The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA, over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount), that I would consider closing the Southern Border a profit making operation .  We build a Wall or …
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with .  Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve !
CNN & others within the Fake News Universe were going wild about my signing MAGA hats for our military in Iraq and Germany .  If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign .  Can you imagine my saying NO ?  We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported !
This isn't about the Wall, everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99 . 9%) .  This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win .  They may have the 10 Senate votes, but we have the issue, Border Security .  2020 !
Brad Blakeman :  The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them .  The President says look, this is your neighborhood, you've got to stand up to protect yourselves .  Don't always look to America .
Brad Blakeman :  The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them .  The Pesident says look, this is your neighborhood, you've got to stand up to protect yourselves .  Don't always look to America .
I totally agree !
There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop .  Time to get tough on Border Security .  Build the Wall !
Border Patrol Agents want the Wall .  Democrat's say they don't want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed), and they don't want ICE .  They don't have much to campaign on, do they ?  An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity !
The reason the DACA for Wall deal didn't get done was that a ridiculous court decision from the 9th Circuit allowed DACA to remain, thereby setting up a Supreme Court case .  After ruling, Dems dropped deal - and that's where we are today, Democrat obstruction of the needed Wall .
The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall, where they almost all recently agreed it should be built, is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years, a  US  record !

Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border .  Need to stop Drugs, Human Trafficking,Gang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country .  Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats ?
Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany .  One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win !
@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit our incredible troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq .  GOD BLESS THE  USA  !
I hope everyone, even the Fake News Media, is having a great Christmas !  Our Country is doing very well .  We are securing our Borders, making great new Trade Deals, and bringing our Troops Back Home .  We are finally putting America First .  MERRY CHRISTMAS !   #MAGA
Merry Christmas !
I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas .  We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete .  Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding .  Billions of Dollars, & lives, will be saved !
Christmas Eve briefing with my team working on North Korea – Progress being made .  Looking forward to my next summit with Chairman Kim !
I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security .  At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about .  Crazy !
Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States .  See ?  Isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the  US , that is 5000 miles away .  Thanks to Saudi A !
The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security .  The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand .  The reporting has been inaccurate on the point .  The problem is, without the Wall, much of the rest of Dollars are wasted !
I never lashed out at the Acting Attorney General of the  US , a man for whom I have great respect .  This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media !
The only problem our economy has is the Fed .  They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders .  The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can't score because he has no touch - he can't putt !
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN !
For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1 . 8 Billion Dollars in CASH &  sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker .
… We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the  US , and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade .  General Mattis did not see this as a problem .  I DO, and it is being fixed !
To those few Senators who think I don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO .  What I don't like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade …
Virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence .  It was only when I made it an important part of my campaign, because people and drugs were pouring into our Country unchecked, that they turned against it .  Desperately needed !
President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey has very strongly informed me that he will eradicate whatever is left of ISIS in Syria … and he is a man who can do it plus, Turkey is right next door .  Our troops are coming home !
The President has been remarkable .  I do not doubt that he will thrive in this new environment, and he will be a constant reminder of what populism is .  Thank you to Tammy Bruce and Steve Hilton .  Presidential Harassment has been with me from the beginning !
The most important way to stop gangs, drugs, human trafficking and massive crime is at our Southern Border .  We need Border Security, and as EVERYONE knows, you can't have Border Security without a Wall .  The Drones & Technology are just bells and whistles .  Safety for America !
Mitch McConnell just told a group of people, and me, that he has been in the  US  Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career .  Tax & Regulation Cuts, VA Choice, Farm Bill, Criminal Justice Reform, Judgeships & much more .  Great !
It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world .  This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq, that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades, and he's right … The generals still don't get the mistake .   @RandPaul
Thanks @RandPaul  I am very proud of the President .  This is exactly what he promised, and I think the people agree with him .  We've been at war too long and in too many places … spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere .  He's different … that's why he got elected .
… Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal, which I ended, yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home .  Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement .  I said NO and the game was over .  #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE !
Senator Bob Corker just stated that, I'm so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years, and that's what I told the people of our state that's what I'd do, serve for two terms .  But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn't endorse him …
We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill .  These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is the mistake of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars .  It all began 19 years ago !
Unthinkable devastation from the tsunami disaster in Indonesia .  More than two hundred dead and nearly a thousand injured or unaccounted for .  We are praying for recovery and healing .  America is with you !
I just had a long and productive call with President @RT_Erdogan of Turkey .  We discussed ISIS, our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of  US  troops from the area .  After many years they are coming home .  We also discussed heavily expanded Trade .
I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019 .  Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing .  He will be great !
The only way to stop drugs, gangs, human trafficking, criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier .  Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works !
When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance .  Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should .  Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had .  Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of  US
If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J .  Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America .  With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media .  Crazy !
Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015 .  Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving .  Grandstander ?  The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event !
I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House !   #MAGA
Senate adjourns until December 27th .
I won an election, said to be one of the greatest of all time, based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe .  We fight for the borders of other countries, but we won't fight for the borders of our own !
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall .  Let work begin !
Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security .
… going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left .  When I became President, ISIS was going wild .  Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains .  We're coming home !
I am in the White House, working hard .  News reports concerning the Shutdown and Syria are mostly FAKE .  We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security (Gangs, Drugs, Human Trafficking & more) but it could be a long stay .  On Syria, we were originally …
OUR GREAT COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY !
Wishing Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a full and speedy recovery !
Some of the many Bills that I am signing in the Oval Office right now .  Cancelled my trip on Air Force One to Florida while we wait to see if the Democrats will help us to protect America's Southern Border !
A design of our Steel Slat Barrier which is totally effective while at the same time beautiful !
Today, it was my honor to sign into law H . R .  7213, the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Act of 2018 .  The Act redesignates the @DHSgov Domestic Nuclear Detection Office as the Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office .  Read more :
Today, it was my great honor to sign the #FirstStepAct - a monumental bi-partisan win for the American people !
I've done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents … not even close !
The Democrats now own the shutdown !
General Anthony Tata, author, Dark Winter .  I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria .  All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS .
There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never, just look at the facts .  The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture .
Thank you @SteveDaines for being willing to go with the so-called nuclear option in order to win on DESPERATELY NEEDED Border Security !  Have my total support .
Mitch, use the Nuclear Option and get it done !  Our Country is counting on you !
Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall, or Fence, and was unable to do so .  Others also have tried .  We will get it done, one way or the other !
Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security !
House Republican Vote, 217-185 .
The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED .  If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time .  People don't want Open Borders and Crime !
No matter what happens today in the Senate, Republican House Members should be very proud of themselves .  They flew back to Washington from all parts of the World in order to vote for Border Security and the Wall .  Not one Democrat voted yes, and we won big .  I am very proud of you !
… on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall .  Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don't .  In Israel the Wall is 99 . 9% successful .  Will not be any different on our Southern Border !  Hundreds of $Billions saved !
The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned .  The fact is there is nothing else's that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years .  It's like the wheel, there is nothing better .  I know tech better than anyone, & technology …
Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything .  He will need Democrat votes, but as shown in the House, good things happen .  If enough Dems don't vote, it will be a Democrat Shutdown !  House Republicans were great yesterday !
Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, last week live from the Oval Office, that the Republicans didn't have the votes for Border Security .  Today the House Republicans voted and won, 217-185 .  Nancy does not have to apologize .  All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY !
Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall .  The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before .  So proud of you all .  Now on to the Senate !
… equipment .  General Mattis was a great help to me in getting allies and other countries to pay their share of military obligations .  A new Secretary of Defense will be named shortly .  I greatly thank Jim for his service !
General Jim Mattis will be retiring, with distinction, at the end of February, after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years .  During Jim's tenure, tremendous progress has been made, especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting …
Democrats, it is time to come together and put the SAFETY of the AMERICAN PEOPLE before POLITICS .  Border security must become a #1 priority !
Farm Bill signing in 15 minutes !  #Emmys #TBT
So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$ .  Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals ?  Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong !
Congress just passed the Criminal Justice Reform Bill known as the #FirstStepAct .  Congratulations !  This is a great bi-partisan achievement for everybody .  When both parties work together we can keep our Country safer .  A wonderful thing for the  USA  !  !
When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill, I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership .  Would be done by end of year (NOW) .  It didn't happen !  We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved  USA  Not good !
With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military .  Remember the Caravans ?  Well, they didn't get through and none are forming or on their way .  Border is tight .  Fake News silent !
The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country .  What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security .   USA  WINS !
… Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the  US  leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us .  I am building by far the most powerful military in the world .  ISIS hits us they are doomed !
Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing ?  Do we want to be there forever ?  Time for others to finally fight …
Getting out of Syria was no surprise .  I've been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer .  Russia, Iran, Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS .  We were doing there work .  Time to come home & rebuild .  #MAGA
I'm proud of the President today to hear that he is declaring victory in Syria .  Senator Rand Paul .   I couldn't agree more with the presidents decision .  By definition, this is the opposite of an Obama decision .  Senator Mike Lee
Trump gets no credit for what he's done in the Middle East .   @IngrahamAngle  So true, thank you Laura !
Col .  Jim Carafano on @IngrahamAngle Trump has made the Middle East a better place .  When Trump came into office, ISIS was running amuck in the Middle East .  Over a million refugees poured into Western Europe - none of that is happening today .  That's all due to Trump .
After historic victories against ISIS, it's time to bring our great young people home !
… In any event, it goes on and on & the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me .  Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of justice .
… sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics .  Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation …
The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc .  Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by …
We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency .
Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA !  Far more money coming to the  US  Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border, including large scale criminal and drug inflow, the United States Military will build the Wall !
In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but when it comes to Border Security and the Military, the Democrats fight to the death .  We won on the Military, which is being completely rebuilt .  One way or the other, we will win on the Wall !
In our Country, so much money has been poured down the drain, for so many years, but the Democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on Boarder Security (including a Wall) and the Military .  We won on the Military, it is being completely rebuilt .  We will win …
… This will keep our communities safer, and provide hope and a second chance, to those who earn it .  In addition to everything else, billions of dollars will be saved .  I look forward to signing this into law !
America is the greatest Country in the world and my job is to fight for ALL citizens, even those who have made mistakes .  Congratulations to the Senate on the bi-partisan passing of a historic Criminal Justice Reform Bill …
… It will be beautiful and, at the same time, give our Country the security that our citizens deserve .  It will go up fast and save us BILLIONS of dollars a month once completed !
The Democrats, are saying loud and clear that they do not want to build a Concrete Wall - but we are not building a Concrete Wall, we are building artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it …
Congratulations to @MarthaMcSally on her appointment by Governor @DougDucey as the Great new Senator from Arizona - I have no doubt she will do a fantastic job !
President Donald J .  Trump's Commission on School Safety examined ways to make our schools safe for all students and teachers .  Read more :
Michael Isikoff was the first to report Dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the Dossier claims .  The whole Russian Collusion thing was a HOAX, but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed ?
… WILL NEVER BE PROVEN AND ARE LIKELY FALSE .   Thank you to Michael Isikoff, Yahoo, for honesty .  What this means is that the FISA WARRANTS and the whole Russian Witch Hunt is a Fraud and a Hoax which should be ended immediately .  Also, it was paid for by Crooked Hillary & DNC !
Russia Dossier reporter now doubts dopey Christopher Steele's claims !  When you get into the details of the Steele Dossier, the specific allegations, we have not seen the evidence to support them .  There's good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations …
Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year .  How was this allowed to happen ?
Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous !  Twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump .  They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase .  They have acknowledged-done NOTHING !
I hope the people over at the Fed will read today's Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake .  Also, don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is .  Stop with the 50 B's .  Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers .  Good luck !
Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn .  Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign .  There was no Collusion !
Biggest outrage yet in the long, winding and highly conflicted Mueller Witch Hunt is the fact that 19,000 demanded Text messages between Peter Strzok and his FBI lover, Lisa Page, were purposely & illegally deleted .  Would have explained whole Hoax, which is now under protest !
Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers & Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations .  I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments .  Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers !
Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Border Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line .  Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control !
It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike .  Take the Victory !
Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Boarder Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line .  Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control !
The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable !  Hurts families badly .  We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare !  A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans !
… The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the insurance policy long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country .  They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago .  Nothing to do with Collusion .  A Democrat Scam !
… a persecution of the President .   Daniel Henninger, The Wall Street Journal .  Thank you, people are starting to see and understand what this Witch Hunt is all about .  Jeff Sessions should be ashamed of himself for allowing this total HOAX to get started in the first place !
It looks here as though General Flynn's defenses are incidental to something larger which is for the prosecution to figure out if it can find a path to Donald Trump without quite knowing what that crime might be .  It stops looking like prosecution and more looking like …
Required television watching is last weeks @marthamaccallum interview with the wonderful wife of Rod Blagojevich and the @trish_regan interview with a Jerome Corsi .  If that doesn't tell you something about what has been going on in our Country, nothing will .  Very sad !

The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now .  Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years .  However, if you don't separate, FAR more people will come .  Smugglers use the kids !
Judge Ken Starr, former Solicitor Generel & Independent Counsel, just stated that, after two years, there is no evidence or proof of collusion & further that there is no evidence that there was a campaign financing violation involving the President .  Thank you Judge .  @FoxNews
At the request of many, I will be reviewing the case of a  US  Military hero, Major Matt Golsteyn, who is charged with murder .  He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas .  @PeteHegseth @FoxNews
Remember, Michael Cohen only became a Rat after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started .  They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE !  Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked's office ?
So where are all the missing Text messages between fired FBI agents Peter S and the lovely Lisa Page, his lover .  Just reported that they have been erased and wiped clean .  What an outrage as the totally compromised and conflicted Witch Hunt moves ever so slowly forward .  Want them !
A REAL scandal is the one sided coverage, hour by hour, of networks like NBC & Democrat spin machines like Saturday Night Live .  It is all nothing less than unfair news coverage and Dem commercials .  Should be tested in courts, can't be legal ?  Only defame & belittle !  Collusion ?
Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone .  Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News .  Witch Hunt !
The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard, run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who, like many others, never had a clue), is flat broke and out of business .  Too bad .  May it rest in peace !
Never in the history of our Country has the press been more dishonest than it is today .  Stories that should be good, are bad .  Stories that should be bad, are horrible .  Many stories, like with the REAL story on Russia, Clinton & the DNC, seldom get reported .  Too bad !
… The Trump Administration will be announcing the new Secretary of the Interior next week .
Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years .  Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation …
Wow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas .  Great news for America !
As I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster !  Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions .  Mitch and Nancy, get it done !
For the record, there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff .  Mick M will do a GREAT job !
… I look forward to working with him in this new capacity as we continue to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !  John will be staying until the end of the year .  He is a GREAT PATRIOT and I want to personally thank him for his service !
I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management & Budget, will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff, replacing General John Kelly, who has served our Country with distinction .  Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration …
Thank you to @tim_cook for agreeing to expand operations in the  US  and thereby creating thousands of jobs !
… Kim Jong Un sees it better than anyone and will fully take advantage of it for his people .  We are doing just fine !
Many people have asked how we are doing in our negotiations with North Korea - I always reply by saying we are in no hurry, there is wonderful potential for great economic success for that country …
China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them .  They have just suspended  US  Tariff Hikes .   US  is doing very well .  China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal .  It could happen, and rather soon !

Let's not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what's right for the American People !
Today, it was my honor to welcome our Nation's newly elected Governors to the @WhiteHouse !
Happy 382nd Birthday @USNationalGuard .  Our entire Nation is forever grateful for all you do 24/7/365 .  We love you !  #Guard382
Just did an interview with @HARRISFAULKNER on @FoxNews, airing now (1pmE . ) Enjoy !
… She will probably be given a pass, despite their terrible ratings .  Congratulations to @RichardGrenell, our great Ambassador to Germany, for having the courage to take this horrible issue on !
If it was a Conservative that said what crazed Mika Brzezinski stated on her show yesterday, using a certain horrible term, that person would be banned permanently from television …
WITCH HUNT !
They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didn't lie and they overrode the FBI .  They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements .  Sad !  …
… guilty even on a civil basis .  Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook .  As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me !
… guilty even on a civil bases .  Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence, which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook .  As a lawyer, Michael has great liability to me !
… stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance .  Cohen was guilty on many charges unrelated to me, but he plead to two campaign charges which were not criminal and of which he probably was not …
I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law .  He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law .  It is called advice of counsel, and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made .  That is why they get paid .  Despite that many campaign finance lawyers have strongly …
I often stated, One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall .  This has never changed .  Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL !
@FLOTUS Melania will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight on @FoxNews at 9 : 00pmE !
The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing, but they can't give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall ?
Another very bad terror attack in France .  We are going to strengthen our borders even more .  Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security !
Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week !  These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars .  It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season .
I don't care what you think of the President … it cannot bleed over to the FBI … Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI …  
-Chris Swecker
James Comey just totally exposed his partisan stance by urging his fellow Democrats to take back the White House in 2020 .  In other words, he is and has been a Democrat .  Comey had no right heading the FBI at any time, but especially after his mind exploded !
Fake News has it purposely wrong .  Many, over ten, are vying for and wanting the White House Chief of Staff position .  Why wouldn't someone want one of the truly great and meaningful jobs in Washington .  Please report news correctly .  Thank you !
Very productive conversations going on with China !  Watch for some important announcements !
Great job by Michael Anton on @foxandfriends .  A true National Security expert !
… People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built .  If the Democrats do not give us the votes to secure our Country, the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall .  They know how important it is !
… I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi .  In 2006, Democrats voted for a Wall, and they were right to do so .  Today, they no longer want Border Security .  They will fight it at all cost, and Nancy must get votes for Speaker .  But the Wall will get built …
… however, for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left, do NOT want Border Security .  They want Open Borders for anyone to come in .  This brings large scale crime and disease .  Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way …
… Ice, Border Patrol and our Military have done a FANTASTIC job of securing our Southern Border .  A Great Wall would be, however, a far easier & less expensive solution .  We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new .  The Democrats, …
Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country, people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls, makeshift Walls & Fences, or Border Patrol Officers & Military .  They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries …
Former FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier .  @LouDobbs  Details on Tuesday night .
James Comey's behind closed doors testimony reveals that there was not evidence of Campaign Collusion with Russia when he left the FBI .  In other words, the Witch Hunt is illegal and should never have been started !
… which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine .  Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me) .  Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced .  WITCH HUNT !
Democrats can't find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey's testimony .  No Smocking Gun … No Collusion .  @FoxNews  That's because there was NO COLLUSION .  So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution, …
I am in the process of interviewing some really great people for the position of White House Chief of Staff .  Fake News has been saying with certainty it was Nick Ayers, a spectacular person who will always be with our #MAGA agenda .  I will be making a decision soon !
The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other  US  Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence, & we are having a great time doing it !  All of this despite the Fake News Media, which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People !
Leakin' James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day .  His Friday testimony was so untruthful !  This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President .  They are now exposed !
On 245  occasions, former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn't know, didn't recall, or couldn't remember things when asked .  Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn't know who signed off and didn't know Christopher Steele .  All lies !
It was my honor to attend today's #ArmyNavyGame in Philadelphia .  A GREAT game played all around by our HEROES .  Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football on the win !
#ArmyNavyGame🇺🇸
Great honor to be headed to the Army-Navy game today .  Will be there shortly, landing now !
… left and right, he then woke up from his dream screaming that HE LIED .  Next time I go to Vietnam I will ask the Dick to travel with me !
Watched Da Nang Dick Blumenthal on television spewing facts almost as accurate as his bravery in Vietnam (which he never saw) .  As the bullets whizzed by Da Nang Dicks head, as he was saving soldiers …
Very sad day & night in Paris .  Maybe it's time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes ?  The  US  was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year !
This is collusion illusion, there is no smoking gun here .  At this late date, after all that we have gone through, after millions have been spent, we have no Russian Collusion .  There is nothing impeachable here .  @GeraldoRivera  Time for the Witch Hunt to END !
… I am thankful to both of these incredible men for their service to our Country !  Date of transition to be determined .
I am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star General Mark Milley, Chief of Staff of the United States Army – as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing General Joe Dunford, who will be retiring …
AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30,000,000), NO COLLUSION !
The idea of a European Military didn't work out too well in W . W .  I or 2 .  But the  US  was there for you, and always will be .  All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO .  Germany is paying 1% while the  US  pays 4 . 3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe .  Fairness !
The Paris Agreement isn't working out so well for Paris .  Protests and riots all over France .  People do not want to pay large sums of money, much to third world countries (that are questionably run), in order to maybe protect the environment .  Chanting We Want Trump !  Love France .
Totally clears the President .  Thank you !
It is being reported that Leakin' James Comey was told by Department of Justice attorneys not to answer the most important questions .  Total bias and corruption at the highest levels of previous Administration .  Force him to answer the questions under oath !
Hopefully Mitch McConnell will ask for a VOTE on Criminal Justice Reform .  It is extremely popular and has strong bipartisan support .  It will also help a lot of people, save taxpayer dollars, and keep our communities safe .  Go for it Mitch !
Mike Pompeo is doing a great job, I am very proud of him .  His predecessor, Rex Tillerson, didn't have the mental capacity needed .  He was dumb as a rock and I couldn't get rid of him fast enough .  He was lazy as hell .  Now it is a whole new ballgame, great spirit at State !
… and one of the most highly respected lawyers and legal minds in the Country, he will be a great addition to our team .  I look forward to having him join our very successful Administration !
I am pleased to announce that I will be nominating The Honorable William P .  Barr for the position of Attorney General of the United States .  As the former AG for George H . W .  Bush …
I am pleased to announce that Heather Nauert, Spokeswoman for the United States Department of State, will be nominated to serve as United Nations Ambassador .  I want to congratulate Heather, and thank Ambassador Nikki Haley for her great service to our Country !
We will be doing a major Counter Report to the Mueller Report .  This should never again be allowed to happen to a future President of the United States !
Today, we honor those who perished 77 years ago at Pearl Harbor, and we salute every veteran who served in World War II over the 4 years that followed that horrific attack .  God Bless America !
It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller Report .  That is Fake News .  Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report .
China talks are going very well !
… the lying and leaking by the people doing the Report, & also Bruce Ohr (and his lovely wife Molly), Comey, Brennan, Clapper, & all of the many fired people of the FBI, be listed in the Report ?  Will the corruption within the DNC & Clinton Campaign be exposed ?  .  . And so much more !
… Foundation be listed at the top of the Report ?  Will the scathing document written about Lyin' James Comey, by the man in charge of the case, Rod Rosenstein (who also signed the FISA Warrant), be a big part of the Report ?  Isn't Rod therefore totally conflicted ?  Will all of …
… overturned, 9-0, in the United States Supreme Court .  Doing same thing to people now .  Will all of the substantial & many contributions made by the 17 Angry Democrats to the Campaign of Crooked Hillary be listed in top of Report .  Will the people that worked for the Clinton …
… Will Robert Mueller's big time conflicts of interest be listed at the top of his Republicans only Report .  Will Andrew Weissman's horrible and vicious prosecutorial past be listed in the Report .  He wrongly destroyed people's lives, took down great companies, only to be …
Robert Mueller and Leakin' Lyin' James Comey are Best Friends, just one of many Mueller Conflicts of Interest .  And bye the way, wasn't the woman in charge of prosecuting Jerome Corsi (who I do not know) in charge of legal at the corrupt Clinton Foundation ?  A total Witch Hunt …
Arizona, together with our Military and Border Patrol, is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area .  WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH .  Big danger .  Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall !
FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE !
Trish_Regan :   Did the FBI follow protocol to obtain the FISA warrant ?  I don't think so .  The Dossier was opposition research funded by opponents .  Don't use Government resources to take down political foes .  Weaponizing Government for gain .  Is this really America ?  Witch Hunt !
Jerome Corsi :  This is not justice, this is not America .  This is a political prosecution .  The Special Prosecutor (Counsel), to get this plea deal, demanded I lie and violate the law .  They're the criminals .  He is not alone .  17 Angry Dems .  People forced to lie .  Sad !   @Trish_Regan
Statement from China :  The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other .  We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days .  I agree !
Does the Fake News Media ever mention the fact that Republicans, with the very important help of my campaign Rallies, WON THE UNITED STATES SENATE, 53 to 47 ?  All I hear is that the Open Border Dems won the House .  Senate alone approves judges & others .  Big Republican Win !
My thoughts and prayers are with the @USMC crew members who were involved in a mid-air collision off the coast of Japan .  Thank you to @USForcesJapan for their immediate response and rescue efforts .  Whatever you need, we are here for you .  @IIIMEF
Without the phony Russia Witch Hunt, and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judge's, Military, Vets, etc . ) my approval rating would be at 75% rather than the 50% just reported by Rasmussen .  It's called Presidential Harassment !
Working hard, thank you !
Doug Wead, a truly great presidential historian, had a wonderful take on a very beautiful moment in history, the funeral service today of President Bush .  Doug was able to brilliantly cover some very important and interesting periods of time !  @LouDobbs
Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is, not restricted .  The World does not want to see, or need, higher oil prices !
Looking forward to being with the Bush family .  This is not a funeral, this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life .  He will be missed !
… considered to be the worst and most dangerous, addictive and deadly substance of them all .  Last year over 77,000 people died from Fentanyl .  If China cracks down on this horror drug, using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers, the results will be incredible !
One of the very exciting things to come out of my meeting with President Xi of China is his promise to me to criminalize the sale of deadly Fentanyl coming into the United States .  It will now be considered a controlled substance .  This could be a game changer on what is …
Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip, including stops, from Argentina .  Not to sound naive or anything, but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting .  ALL subjects discussed !
… China had agreed to start immediately buying  US  products .  @business
China officially echoed President Donald Trump's optimism over bilateral trade talks .  Chinese officials have begun preparing to restart imports of  US  Soybeans & Liquified Natural Gas, the first sign confirming the claims of President Donald Trump and the White House that …
… China does not want Tariffs !
We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China, or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States .  Ultimately, I believe, we will be making a deal - either now or into the future …
… in the world .  I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America's environment .  But American taxpayers – and American workers – shouldn't pay to clean up others countries' pollution .
I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago .  The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters …
Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow .  Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion .  Pays for itself in two months .  Get it done !
… But if a fair deal is able to be made with China, one that does all of the many things we know must be finally done, I will happily sign .  Let the negotiations begin .  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
… I am a Tariff Man .  When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation, I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so .  It will always be the best way to max out our economic power .  We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs .  MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN
… on seeing whether or not a REAL deal with China is actually possible .  If it is, we will get it done .  China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately .  President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will .  But if not remember, …
The negotiations with China have already started .  Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina .  Bob Lighthizer will be working closely with Steve Mnuchin, Larry Kudlow, Wilbur Ross and Peter Navarro …
Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today .  The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania .  The elegance & precision of the last two days have been remarkable !
#Remembering41
Congratulations to newly inaugurated Mexican President @lopezobrador_ .  He had a tremendous political victory with the great support of the Mexican People .  We will work well together for many years to come !
Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H . W .  Bush .
Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats, don't want the truth, they only want lies .  The truth is very bad for their mission !
I will never testify against Trump .  This statement was recently made by Roger Stone, essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about President Trump .  Nice to know that some people still have guts !
… his wife and father-in-law (who has the money ? ) off Scott Free .  He lied for this outcome and should, in my opinion, serve a full and complete sentence .
Michael Cohen asks judge for no Prison Time .  You mean he can do all of the TERRIBLE, unrelated to Trump, things having to do with fraud, big loans, Taxis, etc . , and not serve a long prison term ?  He makes up stories to get a GREAT & ALREADY reduced deal for himself, and get …
We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall .  Either way, people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally !  We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary .  Also, STOP THE DRUGS !
I am certain that, at some time in the future, President Xi and I, together with President Putin of Russia, will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable Arms Race .  The  US  spent 716 Billion Dollars this year .  Crazy !
President Xi and I have a very strong and personal relationship .  He and I are the only two people that can bring about massive and very positive change, on trade and far beyond, between our two great Nations .  A solution for North Korea is a great thing for China and ALL !
Farmers will be a a very BIG and FAST beneficiary of our deal with China .  They intend to start purchasing agricultural product immediately .  We make the finest and cleanest product in the World, and that is what China wants .  Farmers, I LOVE YOU !
My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one .  Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward !  Very good things will happen .  We are dealing from great strength, but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed .  Level the field !
China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the  US  Currently the tariff is 40% .
This week, Jews around the world will celebrate the miracles of Hanukkah .  @FLOTUS Melania and I send our very best wishes for a blessed and Happy Hanukkah !
… However, out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H . W .  Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference .
I was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving Argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20 …
President George H . W .  Bush led a long, successful and beautiful life .   Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family .  His accomplishments were great from beginning to end .  He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all !
Statement from President Donald J .  Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on the Passing of Former President George H . W .  Bush
Watch @seanhannity on @FoxNews NOW .  Enjoy !
Great day at the #G20Summit in Buenos Aires, Argentina .  Thank you !
Great reviews on the USMCA - sooo much better than NAFTA !
To the Great people of Alaska .  You have been hit hard by a big one .  Please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you .  Your Federal Government will spare no expense .  God Bless you ALL !
Just signed one of the most important, and largest, Trade Deals in  US  and World History .  The United States, Mexico and Canada worked so well together in crafting this great document .  The terrible NAFTA will soon be gone .  The USMCA will be fantastic for all !
#USMCA🇺🇸🇲🇽🇨🇦
… Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia .  Put up zero money, zero guarantees and didn't do the project .  Witch Hunt !
Oh, I get it !  I am a very good developer, happily living my life, when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly) .  Against all odds, I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool, talked about it on the campaign trail …
Arrived in Argentina with a very busy two days planned .  Important meetings scheduled throughout .  Our great Country is extremely well represented .  Will be very productive !
Alan Dershowitz :  These are not crimes .  He (Mueller) has no authority to be a roving Commissioner .  I don't see any evidence of crimes .   This is an illegal Hoax that should be ended immediately .  Mueller refuses to look at the real crimes on the other side .  Where is the IG REPORT ?
This demonstrates the Robert Mueller and his partisans have no evidence, not a whiff of collusion, between Trump and the Russians .  Russian project legal .  Trump Tower meeting (son Don), perfectly legal .  He wasn't involved with hacking .      Gregg Jarrett .   A total Witch Hunt !
Just landed in Argentina with @FLOTUS Melania !  #G20Summit
As RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel oversaw history defying gains in the Senate and unprecedented fundraising strength .  I have asked her to serve another term for my 2020 re-elect, because there is no one better for the job !
We have been working hard on this - and it's only going to get better !
With all of the new books coming out you can't forget two of the great originals written by @GreggJarrett and @JudgeJeanine Pirro .  Their books both went to #1 .  Go get them now, the phony Witch Hunt is well explained !
@DBongino's new book, Spygate :  The Attempted Sabotage of Donald J .  Trump, is terrific .  He's tough, he's smart, and he really gets it .  His book is on sale now, I highly recommend !
… They have really done a great job in capturing my long-held views and ideas .  This book is on sale now - a terrific read of a really interesting subject !
@StephenMoore and Arthur Laffer, two very talented men, have just completed an incredible book on my Economic Policies or, as they call it, #TRUMPONOMICS …
@SteveScalise has written an absolutely fascinating book (BACK IN THE GAME) on the world of  DC  politics, and more .  He has experienced so much, in a short period of time .  Few people have had his bravery or courage, and he has come all the way back .  A big power and great person !
… in Argentina with President Vladimir Putin .  I look forward to a meaningful Summit again as soon as this situation is resolved !
Based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to Ukraine from Russia, I have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting …
Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the  USA  because of the Tariffs being charged to China, and there is a long way to go .  If companies don't want to pay Tariffs, build in the  USA  Otherwise, lets just make our Country richer than ever before !
When will this illegal Joseph McCarthy style Witch Hunt, one that has shattered so many innocent lives, ever end-or will it just go on forever ?  After wasting more than $40,000,000 (is that possible ? ), it has proven only one thing-there was NO Collusion with Russia .  So Ridiculous !
Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime ?  At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren't even looking at the atrocious, and perhaps subversive, crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats .  A total disgrace !
General Motors is very counter to what other auto, and other, companies are doing .  Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country .  Auto companies are pouring into the  US , including BMW, which just announced a major new plant .  The  USA  is booming !
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt .  This total Hoax will be studied for years !
Sebastian Gorka, a very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House, has just written an excellent book, Why We Fight .  Much will be learned from this very good read !
On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and the entire Trump family, I want to wish you all a very MERRY CHRISTMAS !  May this Christmas Season bring peace to your hearts, warmth to your homes, cheer to your spirits and JOY TO THE WORLD !  #NCTL2018🎄
Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that will create 600 good-paying  US  JOBS .  Steel JOBS are coming back to America, just like I predicted .  Congratulations to Steel Dynamics !
… and G . M .  would not be closing their plants in Ohio, Michigan & Maryland .  Get smart Congress .  Also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the  US  for decades .  The President has great power on this issue - Because of the G . M .  event, it is being studied now !
The reason that the small truck business in the  US  is such a go to favorite is that, for many years, Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country .  It is called the chicken tax .  If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here …
While the disgusting Fake News is doing everything within their power not to report it that way, at least 3 major players are intimating that the Angry Mueller Gang of Dems is viciously telling witnesses to lie about facts & they will get relief .  This is our Joseph McCarthy Era !
Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi .  We are all very proud of you !
Brenda Snipes, in charge of voting in Broward County, Florida, was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it .  Just kidding, she is a fine, very honorable and highly respected voting tactician !
The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace .  They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don't want to look at the DNC Server), but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED & acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena !
… for electric cars .  General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) - don't think that bet is going to pay off .  I am here to protect America's Workers !
Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO, Mary Barra, for closing plants in Ohio, Michigan and Maryland .  Nothing being closed in Mexico & China .  The  US  saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get !  We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including …
Polls are open in Mississippi .  We need Cindy Hyde-Smith in Washington .  GO OUT AND VOTE .  Thanks !
… terrible Gang of Angry Democrats .  Look at their past, and look where they come from .  The now $30,000,000 Witch Hunt continues and they've got nothing but ruined lives .  Where is the Server ?  Let these terrible people go back to the Clinton Foundation and Justice Department !
… The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint, when in actuality he is the exact opposite .  He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System, where he is only looking at one side and not the other .  Heroes will come of this, and it won't be Mueller and his …
The Phony Witch Hunt continues, but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side, not the other .  Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people, ruining lives for them refusing to lie .  Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue …
… starts today, election is on December 4th .  @VoteBradRaff is tough on Crime and Borders, Loves our Military and Vets .  He will be great for jobs !
Brad Raffensperger will be a fantastic Secretary of State for Georgia - will work closely with @BrianKempGA .  It is really important that you get out and vote for Brad - early voting …
… and false way .  Something has to be done, including the possibility of the United States starting our own Worldwide Network to show the World the way we really are, GREAT !
While CNN doesn't do great in the United States based on ratings, outside of the  US  they have very little competition .  Throughout the world, CNN has a powerful voice portraying the United States in an unfair …
On the ten-year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack, the  US  stands with the people of India in their quest for justice .  The attack killed 166 innocents, including six Americans .  We will never let terrorists win, or even come close to winning !
… hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met, saw or spoke to a Russian during this period ?  So many campaign workers, people inside from the beginning, ask me why they have not been called (they want to be) .  There was NO Collusion & Mueller knows it !
When Mueller does his final report, will he be covering all of his conflicts of interest in a preamble, will he be recommending action on all of the crimes of many kinds from those on the other side(whatever happened to Podesta ? ), and will he be putting in statements from …
Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants, many of whom are stone cold criminals, back to their countries .  Do it by plane, do it by bus, do it anyway you want, but they are NOT coming into the  USA  We will close the Border permanently if need be .  Congress, fund the WALL !
… children from parents, as did Bush etc . , because that is the policy and law .  I tried to keep them together but the problem is, when you do that, vast numbers of additional people storm the Border .  So with Obama seperation is fine, but with Trump it's not .  Fake 60 Minutes !
@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration .  In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are, but it was in 2014 during O years .  Obama separated …
Clinton Foundation donations drop 42% - which shows that they illegally played the power game .  They monetized their political influence through the Foundation .  During her tenure the State Department was put in the service of the Clinton Foundation .   Andrew McCarthy
Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection .  The European Union, for many years, has taken advantage of us on Trade, and then they don't live up to their Military commitment through NATO .  Things must change fast !
General Anthony Tata :  President Trump is a man of his word & he said he was going to be tough on the Border, and he is tough on the Border .  He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat .  It's the right move by President Trump .  Thanks General !
Mississippi, Vote for @cindyhydesmith on Tuesday .  Respected by all .  We need her in Washington !  .  Thanks !
So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T) .  Add that, which is like a big Tax Cut, to our other good Economic news .  Inflation down (are you listening Fed) !
Would be very SMART if Mexico would stop the Caravans long before they get to our Southern Border, or if originating countries would not let them form (it is a way they get certain people out of their country and dump in  US  No longer) .  Dems created this problem .  No crossings !
The large and violent French protests don't take into account how badly the United States has been treated on Trade by the European Union or on fair and reasonable payments for our GREAT military protection .  Both of these topics must be remedied soon .
I will be in Gulfport and Tupelo, Mississippi, on Monday night doing two Rallies for Senator Hyde-Smith, who has a very important Election on Tuesday .  She is an outstanding person who is strong on the Border, Crime, Military, our great Vets, Healthcare & the 2nd A .  Needed in  DC
Victor Davis Hanson was a very good and interesting guest of Mark Levin on @FoxNews .  He wrote a highly touted book called The Second World Wars and a new book will soon be coming out called The Case For Trump .  Recommend both .  @marklevinshow
… All will stay in Mexico .  If for any reason it becomes necessary, we will CLOSE our Southern Border .  There is no way that the United States will, after decades of abuse, put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore !
Migrants at the Southern Border will not be allowed into the United States until their claims are individually approved in court .  We only will allow those who come into our Country legally .  Other than that our very strong policy is Catch and Detain .  No Releasing into the U . S …
I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @USTreasury Secretary @StevenMnuchin1 .  The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary, quoting phony sources or jealous people, but they aren't true .  They never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story .
Really good Criminal Justice Reform has a true shot at major bipartisan support .  @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell and @SenSchumer have a real chance to do something so badly needed in our country .  Already passed, with big vote, in House .  Would be a major victory for ALL !

Republicans and Democrats MUST come together, finally, with a major Border Security package, which will include funding for the Wall .  After 40 years of talk, it is finally time for action .  Fix the Border, for once and for all, NOW !
Our highly trained security professionals are not allowed to do their job on the Border because of the Judicial Activism and Interference by the 9th Circuit .  Nevertheless, they are working hard to make America a safer place, though hard to do when anybody filing a lawsuit wins !
This is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC, and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record !

Will be speaking with our great military in different parts of the world, through teleconference, at 9 : 00  AM  Eastern .  Then it will be off to see our Coast Guard patriots & to thank them for the great job they have been doing, especially with the hurricanes .  Happy Thanksgiving !
… and Safety at the Border, or anywhere else .  They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe .  Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB !  If not there will be only bedlam, chaos, injury and death .  We want the Constitution as written !
Justice Roberts can say what he wants, but the 9th Circuit is a complete & total disaster .  It is out of control, has a horrible reputation, is overturned more than any Circuit in the Country, 79%, & is used to get an almost guaranteed result .  Judges must not Legislate Security …
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL !
It's a mean & nasty world out there, the Middle East in particular .  This is a long and historic commitment, & one that is absolutely vital to America's national security .  @SecPompeo  I agree 100% .  In addition, many Billions of Dollars of purchases made in  US , big Jobs & Oil !
You just can't win with the Fake News Media .  A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low, more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation .  Sorry everyone !
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming ?
79% of these decisions have been overturned in the 9th Circuit .  @FoxNews  A terrible, costly and dangerous disgrace .  It has become a dumping ground for certain lawyers looking for easy wins and delays .  Much talk over dividing up the 9th Circuit into 2 or 3 Circuits .  Too big !
There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan .  We will stop them .  Catch and Detain !  Judicial Activism, by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens, is putting our country in great danger .  Not good !
Thank you to President Trump on the Border .  No American President has ever done this before .  Hector Garza, National Border Patrol Council
… are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned .  Please study the numbers, they are shocking .  We need protection and security - these rulings are making our country unsafe !  Very dangerous and unwise !
Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have Obama judges, and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country .  It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an independent judiciary, but if it is why …
Great new book out, Mad Politics :  Keeping Your Sanity in a World Gone Crazy by @RealDrGina Loudon .  Go out and get your copy today — a great read !
‘Trump Imitation Syndrome' is afflicting the president's liberal enemies 

Thank you @MGoodwin_NYPost !
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Oil prices getting lower .  Great !  Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World .  Enjoy !  $54, was just $82 .  Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower !
AMERICA FIRST !
So-called comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents' Dinner that this year, for the first time in decades, they will have an author instead of a comedian .  Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition !  Maybe I will go ?
I hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the Argentine submarine San Juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors .  I look forward to hearing more from my friend President @MauricioMacri in Argentina later this month .
The Fake News is showing old footage of people climbing over our Ocean Area Fence .  This is what it really looks like - no climbers anymore under our Administration !
… We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us, Bin Laden being a prime example, Afghanistan being another .  They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return .  That's ENDING !
Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did .  I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center .  President Clinton famously missed his shot .  We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there .  Fools !  .  .
@cindyhydesmith loves Mississippi and our Great  USA
From day one Rick Scott never wavered .  He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida .  Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign !
Catch and Release is an obsolete term .  It is now Catch and Detain .  Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the  USA , often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for  US  Asylum, will be detained or turned away .  Dems must approve Border Security & Wall NOW !
The Mayor of Tijuana, Mexico, just stated that the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants, the backlog could last 6 months .  Likewise, the  US  is ill-prepared for this invasion, and will not stand for it .  They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico .  Go home !
So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate, but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate !
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on @FoxNews at 2 : 00  PM  and 7 : 00  PM  Enjoy !
Incredible to be with our GREAT HEROES today in California .  We will always be with you !
Heading to California with @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy, @RepLaMalfa, and @KenCalvert .  Look forward to being with our brave Firefighters, First Responders and @FEMA, along with the many brave People of California .  We are with you all the way – God Bless you all !
… I can't imagine any President having a better or closer relationship with their Vice President then the two of us .  Just more FAKE NEWS, the Enemy of the People !
The New York Times did a phony story, as usual, about my relationship with @VP Mike Pence .  They made up sources and refused to ask me, the only one that would know, for a quote …
Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida .  He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with !
I can get Nancy Pelosi as many votes as she wants in order for her to be Speaker of the House .  She deserves this victory, she has earned it - but there are those in her party who are trying to take it away .  She will win !  @TomReedCongress
Thank you @JerryBrownGov .  Look forward to joining you and @GavinNewsom tomorrow in California .  We are with you !
… their country's flag .  Can this be possible ?  Yes, because it is all a BIG CON, and the American taxpayer is paying for it !
Isn't it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting  USA  asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving …
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia .  Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future !  Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia !
Congratulations to Ron DeSantis on becoming the new Governor of Florida .  Against all odds, he fought & fought & fought, the result being a historic victory .  He never gave up and never will .  He will be a great Governor !
PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM
People are not being told that the Republican Party is on track to pick up two seats in the  US  Senate, and epic victory :  53 to 47 .  The Fake News Media only wants to speak of the House, where the Midterm results were better than other sitting Presidents .
Today in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse, it was my true privilege to award seven extraordinary Americans with the Presidential Medal of Freedom …

It is our sacred duty to support America's Service Members every single day they wear the uniform – and every day after when they return home as Veterans .  Together we will HONOR those who defend us, we will CHERISH those who protect us, and we will celebrate the amazing heroes …
Last year, I signed the landmark VA Accountability Act to ensure those who mistreat our Veterans can be held fully accountable .  Since my inauguration, we have removed more than 3,600 government employees who were not giving our Vets the care they deserve …
It was my great honor to host a @WhiteHouse Conference on Supporting Veterans & Military Families … 

To everyone here today who has served our Country in uniform, & to every Veteran & Military family across our land, I want to express the eternal gratitude of our entire Nation !
@FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to visit with our GREAT  US  MARINES at the Marine Barracks here in Washington,  DC  We love you @USMC @MBWDC !
The only Collusion is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others .  Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC ?  They still don't have it .  Check out how biased Facebook, Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats .  That's the real Collusion !
Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people .  Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary, Comey, McCabe, Lisa Page & her lover, Peter S, and all of his friends on the other side ?
… care how many lives the ruin .  These are Angry People, including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller, who worked for Obama for 8 years .  They won't even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side .  A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY !
The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess .  They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts .  They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want .  They are a disgrace to our Nation and don't …
The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good .  We are the envy of the world .  But anytime I even think about making changes, the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy, always seeking to make us look as bad as possible !  Very dishonest !
Our pledge to hire American includes those leaving prison and looking for a very fresh start — new job, and new life .  The legislation I am supporting today contains many significant reforms .  Read more here :
I am grateful to be here today w/ Members of the House & Senate who have poured their time, heart and energy into the crucial issue of Prison Reform .  Working together w/ my Admin over the last two years, these members have reached a bipartisan agreement …
Just spoke to Governor Jerry Brown to let him know that we are with him, and the people of California, all the way !
Was just briefed by @FEMA_Brock and @SecretaryZinke, who are in California .  Thank you to the great Firefighters, First Responders and @FEMA for the incredible job they are doing w/ the California Wildfires .  Our Nation appreciates your heroism, courage & genius .  God Bless you all !
Not seen in many years, America's steelworkers get a hard-earned raise because of my Administration's policies to help bring back the  US  steel industry, which is critical to our National Security .  I will always protect America and its workers !
Boom :  Record high business optimism, need for employees at 45-year high
It was my great honor to host a celebration of Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights, in the Roosevelt Room at the @WhiteHouse this afternoon .  Very, very special people !
Today, we gathered for Diwali, a holiday observed by Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains throughout the United States & around the world .  Hundreds of millions of people have gathered with family & friends to light the Diya and to mark the beginning of a New Year .

We mourn for the lives lost and we pray for the victims of the California Wildfires .  I want to thank the Firefighters and First Responders for their incredible courage in the face of grave danger …
The story in the New York Times concerning North Korea developing missile bases is inaccurate .  We fully know about the sites being discussed, nothing new - and nothing happening out of the normal .  Just more Fake News .  I will be the first to let you know if things go bad !
When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida ?  The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to find enough votes, too much spotlight on them now !
By the way, when the helicopter couldn't fly to the first cemetery in France because of almost zero visibility, I suggested driving .  Secret Service said NO, too far from airport & big Paris shutdown .  Speech next day at American Cemetery in pouring rain !  Little reported-Fake News !

… MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN !
The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10% .  He was just trying to get onto another subject .  By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so !  …
On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the  US  The problem is that France makes it very hard for the  US  to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the  US  makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs .  Not fair, must change !
Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the  US , China and Russia .  But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two - How did that work out for France ?  They were starting to learn German in Paris before the  US  came along .  Pay for NATO or not !
I just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California .  Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on .  I am with you all the way .  God Bless all of the victims and families affected .
Hopefully, Saudi Arabia and OPEC will not be cutting oil production .  Oil prices should be much lower based on supply !
American Cable Association has big problems with Comcast .  They say that Comcast routinely violates Antitrust Laws .  These guys are acting much worse, and have much more potential for damage to consumers, than anything AT&T-Time Warner would do .  Charlie Gasparino
The California Fire Fighters, FEMA and  First Responders are amazing and very brave .  Thank you and God Bless you all !
The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches !
The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged .  An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected .  Must go with Election Night !
… of money spent on protecting other countries, and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses .  It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection, or protect themselves … and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR !
… hundreds of billions of dollars, for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade .  I told them that this situation cannot continue - It is, and always has been, ridiculously unfair to the United States .  Massive amounts …
Just returned from France where much was accomplished in my meetings with World Leaders .  Never easy bringing up the fact that the  US  must be treated fairly, which it hasn't, on both Military and Trade .  We pay for LARGE portions of other countries military protection, …
Exactly 100 years ago today, on November 11th, 1918, World War I came to an end .  We are gathered together, at this hallowed resting place, to pay tribute to the brave Americans who gave their last breath in that mighty struggle …
Poland, a great country - Congratulations on the 100th Anniversary of your Independence .  I will never forget my time there !
Beautiful ceremony today in Paris commemorating the end of World War One .  Many World leaders in attendance .  Thank you to @EmmanuelMacron, President of France !  Now off to Suresnes American Cemetery to make speech in honor of our great heroes !  Then back to the  USA
On this Veterans Day — the 100th Anniversary of the end of WWI, we honor the brave HEROES who fought for America in the Great War, and every Veteran who has worn the uniform and kept our Nation Safe, Strong and FREE !
With proper Forest Management, we can stop the devastation constantly going on in California .  Get Smart !
These California fires are expanding very, very quickly (in some cases 80-100 acres a minute) .  If people don't evacuate quickly, they risk being overtaken by the fire .  Please listen to evacuation orders from State and local officials !
More than 4,000 are fighting the Camp and Woolsey Fires in California that have burned over 170,000 acres .  Our hearts are with those fighting the fires, the 52,000 who have evacuated, and the families of the 11 who have died .  The destruction is catastrophic .  God Bless them all .
Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida !  We are watching closely !
Had very productive meetings and calls for our Country today .  Meeting tonight with World Leaders !
Happy 243rd Birthday to our GREAT  US  Marine Corps🇺🇸
I am in Paris getting ready to celebrate the end of World War One .  Is there anything better to celebrate than the end of a war, in particular that one, which was one of the bloodiest and worst of all time ?
There is no reason for these massive, deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor .  Billions of dollars are given each year, with so many lives lost, all because of gross mismanagement of the forests .  Remedy now, or no more Fed payments !
… Mr .  Whitaker is very highly thought of by @SenJoniErnst, Senator @ChuckGrassley, Ambassador @TerryBranstad, Leonard Leo of Federalist Society, and many more .  I feel certain he will make an outstanding Acting Attorney General !
Matthew G .  Whitaker is a highly respected former  US  Attorney from Iowa .  He was chosen by Jeff Sessions to be his Chief of Staff .  I did not know Mr .  Whitaker .  Likewise, as Chief, I did not know Mr .  Whitaker except primarily as he traveled with A . G .  Sessions .  No social contact …
President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the  US , China and Russia .  Very insulting, but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO, which the  US  subsidizes greatly !
Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON'T MATCH .  Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election ?  We must protect our Democracy !
Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties .  The WORLD is now watching closely !
In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County, which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a number, couldn't do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory !
Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him back into play .  Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he's back in play !  ?  This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy !
Rick Scott was up by 50,000+ votes on Election Day, now they found many votes and he is only up 15,000 votes .  The Broward Effect .  How come they never find Republican votes ?
Jeff Flake(y) doesn't want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel, he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the crime of doing a terrible job !  A weak and ineffective guy !
As soon as Democrats sent their best Election stealing lawyer, Marc Elias, to Broward County they miraculously started finding Democrat votes .  Don't worry, Florida - I am sending much better lawyers to expose the FRAUD !
You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday ?  Let's blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin !
@BrianKempGA ran a great race in Georgia – he won .  It is time to move on !
Presidential Proclamation Addressing Mass Migration Through the Southern Border of the United States
Law Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach .  Florida voted for Rick Scott !
… Great bravery shown by police .  California Highway Patrol was on scene within 3 minutes, with first officer to enter shot numerous times .  That Sheriff's Sergeant died in the hospital .  God bless all of the victims and families of the victims .  Thank you to Law Enforcement .
I have been fully briefed on the terrible shooting in California .  Law Enforcement and First Responders, together with the FBI, are on scene .  13 people, at this time, have been reported dead .  Likewise, the shooter is dead, along with the first police officer to enter the bar …
… We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service, and wish him well !  A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date .
We are pleased to announce that Matthew G .  Whitaker, Chief of Staff to Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the Department of Justice, will become our new Acting Attorney General of the United States .  He will serve our Country well …
According to NBC News, Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%) .  You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt, led by 17 Angry Democrats, is all about !
In all fairness, Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats .  If they give her a hard time, perhaps we will add some Republican votes .  She has earned this great honor !
If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level, then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information, and much else, at the Senate level .  Two can play that game !
To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election, just remember two words - FAKE NEWS !
I will be doing a news conference at The White House - 11 : 30  AM  Will be discussing our success in the Midterms !
Those that worked with me in this incredible Midterm Election, embracing certain policies and principles, did very well .  Those that did not, say goodbye !  Yesterday was such a very Big Win, and all under the pressure of a Nasty and Hostile Media !
Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida .  Congratulations to Ron and family !
Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night, including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out, and hoping, on Trade Deals .  Now we can all get back to work and get things done !
@DavidAsmanfox  How do the Democrats respond to this ?  Think of how his position with Republicans improves-all the candidates who won tonight .  They realize how important he is because of what he did in campaigning for them .  They owe him their political career .  Thanks, I agree !
… unbelievably lucky to have him and I'm just awed at how well they've done .  It's all the Trump magic - Trump is the magic man .  Incredible, he's got the entire media against him, attacking him every day, and he pulls out these enormous wins .  Ben Stein, The Capitalist Code
There's only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election .  Mr .  Trump has magic about him .  This guy has magic coming out of his ears .  He is an astonishing vote getter & campaigner .  The Republicans are …
Tremendous success tonight .  Thank you to all !

There is a rumor, put out by the Democrats, that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early .  It is Fake News .  He met me at the plane when I arrived, spoke at the great Rally, & stayed to the very end .  In fact, I said goodbye to him and left before he did .  Deception !
A fantastic evening in Cape Girardeau, Missouri .  Josh @HawleyMO will be a tireless champion for YOU .  He is great on jobs, great on tax cuts, and tough on crime .  He shares your values, and he will always support our Military, Vets and Police !  Get out tomorrow and VOTE for Josh !  !
A vote for Claire McCaskill is a vote for Schumer, Pelosi, Waters, and their socialist agenda .  Claire voted IN FAVOR of deadly Sanctuary Cities - she would rather protect criminal aliens than American citizens, which is why she needs to be voted out of office .  Vote @HawleyMO !
A fantastic evening in Girardeau, Missouri .  Josh @HawleyMO will be a tireless champion for YOU .  He is great on jobs, great on tax cuts, and tough on crime .  He shares your values, and he will always support our Military, Vets and Police !  Get out tomorrow and VOTE for Josh !  !

Bill Nelson is kind of an empty figure in Washington .  You never hear his name, he's never in debates on key issues - he is just under the radar .  Chris Wallace on @FoxNews  In other words, Nelson is a stiff .

REMEMBER FLORIDA :  I have been President of the United States for almost two years .  During that time Senator Bill Nelson didn't call me once .  Rick Scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for Florida .  Did a GREAT job on hurricanes .  VOTE SCOTT !
So funny to see the CNN Fake Suppression Polls and false rhetoric .  Watch for real results Tuesday .  We are lucky CNN's ratings are so low .  Don't fall for the Suppression Game .  Go out & VOTE .  Remember, we now have perhaps the greatest Economy (JOBS) in the history of our Country !
I need @claudiatenney of #NY22 to be re-elected in order to get our big plans moving .  Her opponent would be a disaster .  Nobody works harder than Claudia, and she is a producer .  I look forward to working together with her - she has my Strongest Endorsement !  Vote Claudia !
No matter what she says, Senator Claire McCaskill will always vote against us and the Great State of Missouri !  Vote for Josh Hawley - he will be a great Senator !
If @AndrewGillum did the same job with Florida that he has done in Tallahassee as Mayor, the State will be a crime ridden, overtaxed mess .  @RonDeSantisFL will be a great Governor .  VOTE !  !  !  !  !  !
@DebbieStabenow voted against Tax Cuts, great Healthcare, Supreme Court Justices and all of the many things the people of Michigan wanted and need .  She is an automatic far left vote, controlled by her bosses .  John James can be a truly great Senator !
Dana Rohrabacher has been a great Congressman for his District and for the people of Cal .  He works hard and is respected by all - he produces !  Dems are desperate to replace Dana by spending vast sums to elect a super liberal who is weak on Crime and bad for our Military & Vets !
John James, running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan, is a spectacular young star of the future .  We should make him a star of the present .  A distinguished West Point Grad and Vet, people should Vote Out Schumer Puppet Debbie Stabenow, who does nothing for Michigan !
In just 2 days, the people of Tennessee are going to elect @VoteMarsha Blackburn to the United States Senate to protect your jobs, defend your borders, and CONTINUE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !  Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Marsha !

In all the time I've been President, almost two years, never once did Senator Bill Nelson call me to ask for help for the Great State of Florida .  I never see him until election time …
Rumor has it that Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is paying for Facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket .  Donnelly is trying to steal the election ?  Isn't that what Russia did !  ?
Arizona is such a Great State but it needs Border Security which @MarthaMcSally will provide, and Krysten Sinema doesn't even think about .  If it were up to Sinema - drugs, crime and illegal traffic will be flowing into Arizona at an ever increasing pace .  Vote for Martha !
If Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi gain the majority, they will try to raise your taxes, restore job-killing regulations, shut down your coal mines and timber mills, take away your healthcare, impose socialism, and ERASE your borders .  VOTE for @MattForMontana and @GregForMontana !
Landing in Montana now - at least everybody admits that my lines and crowds are far bigger than Barack Obama's …
New York, get out and VOTE for @JohnFasoNy, a great and hardworking Congressman .  We need John's voice in  DC  His opponent just moved to the area - is Pro-Iran and Anti-Israel .  Vote for John .  Has my Strong Endorsement !
Get out and VOTE for @DeanHeller !
A vicious accuser of Justice Kavanaugh has just admitted that she was lying, her story was totally made up, or FAKE !  Can you imagine if he didn't become a Justice of the Supreme Court because of her disgusting False Statements .  What about the others ?  Where are the Dems on this ?
Thank you to @PeteHegseth and @KatiePavlich for your nice, and very wise, statements on the Economy .  You both really get it !  @foxandfriends
A vicious accuser of Justice Kavanough has just admitted that she was lying, her story was totally made up, or FAKE !  Can you imagine if he didn't become a Justice of the Supreme Court because of her disgusting False Statements .  What about the others ?  Where are the Dems on this ?
Heading to Montana and Florida today !  Everyone is excited about the Jobs Numbers - 250,000 new jobs in October .  Also, wages rising .  Wow !
Indiana Rally, and Coach Bobby Knight, were incredible last night .  Packed House in Honor of Mike Braun for Senate .  Mike will be a GREAT Senator .  Don't forget to VOTE !

Massive #MAGARally🇺🇸tonight in Indiana, thank you .  Everyone get out and
Republicans believe our Country should be a Sanctuary for law-abiding Americans – not criminal aliens .  And Republicans will ALWAYS stand with the HEROES of @ICEgov, @CBP, and Law Enforcement !

Together, we are Making America Safe and Great Again !

Just had a long and very good conversation with President Xi Jinping of China .  We talked about many subjects, with a heavy emphasis on Trade .  Those discussions are moving along nicely with meetings being scheduled at the G-20 in Argentina .  Also had good discussion on North Korea !
That's because they treat me fairly ! 
@FoxNews tops @CNN and @MSNBC combined in October cable news ratings
Fantastic evening in Florida with great PATRIOTS at a beautiful #MAGARally .  Get out and   so we can continue MAKING AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN !
THANK YOU FLORIDA !  Get out and VOTE Republican !  #MAGA🇺🇸
It is outrageous what the Democrats are doing to our Country .  Vote Republican now !
#JOBSNOTMOBS !  VOTE REPUBLICAN NOW !  !
Yesterday in Pittsburgh I was really impressed with Congressman Keith Rothfus (far more so than any other local political figure) .  His sincere level of compassion, grief and sorrow for the events that took place was, in its own way, very inspiring .  Vote for Keith !
Harry Reid, when he was sane, agreed with us on Birthright Citizenship !
Paul Ryan should be focusing on holding the Majority rather than giving his opinions on Birthright Citizenship, something he knows nothing about !  Our new Republican Majority will work on this, Closing the Immigration Loopholes and Securing our Border !
Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems !
Donald Trump has made good on his promises, and it drives Democrats Crazy !  Brad Blakeman @FoxNews
The World is using our laws to our detriment .  They laugh at the Stupidity they see !
… Harry Reid was right in 1993, before he and the Democrats went insane and started with the Open Borders (which brings massive Crime) stuff .  Don't forget the nasty term Anchor Babies .  I will keep our Country safe .  This case will be settled by the United States Supreme Court !
So-called Birthright Citizenship, which costs our Country billions of dollars and is very unfair to our citizens, will be ended one way or the other .  It is not covered by the 14th Amendment because of the words subject to the jurisdiction thereof .  Many legal scholars agree …
Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh .  The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad & solemn day .  We were treated so warmly .  Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away .  The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful !
Stock Market up more than 400 points yesterday .  Today looks to be another good one .  Companies earnings are great !
Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh .  The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad and solemn day .  We were treaty so warmly .  Small protest was not seen by us, staged far away .  The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful !
Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border .  Many more troops coming .  We will NOT let these Caravans, which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members, into the  US  Our Border is sacred, must come in legally .  TURN AROUND !
The Caravans are made up of some very tough fighters and people .  Fought back hard and viciously against Mexico at Northern Border before breaking through .  Mexican soldiers hurt, were unable, or unwilling to stop Caravan .  Should stop them before they reach our Border, but won't !
Congressman @KevinYoder has fought hard for the People of Kansas .  Highly respected, strong on Crime, the Border, Military, Vets and Second Amendment .  Kevin has my Total Endorsement !
… Richard Cordray will let you down, just like he did when he destroyed the government agency that he ran .  Clone of Pocahontas, that's not for Ohio .  Mike has my Total Endorsement !
@MikeDeWine will be a great Governor for the People of Ohio .  He is an outstanding man who loves his State – and always produces big …
Just out :  Consumer Confidence hits highest level since 2000 .
If the Fed backs off and starts talking a little more Dovish, I think we're going to be right back to our 2,800 to 2,900 target range that we've had for the S&P 500 .  Scott Wren, Wells Fargo .
The Stock Market is up massively since the Election, but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms .  If you want your Stocks to go down, I strongly suggest voting Democrat .  They like the Venezuela financial model, High Taxes & Open Borders !
Congressman Kevin Brady of Texas is so popular in his District, and far beyond, that he doesn't need any help - but I am giving it to him anyway .  He is a great guy and the absolute King of Cutting Taxes .  Highly respected by all, he loves his State & Country .  Strong Endorsement !
Congressman Andy Barr of Kentucky, who just had a great debate with his Nancy Pelosi run opponent, has been a winner for his State .  Strong on Crime, the Border, Tax Cuts, Military, Vets and 2nd Amendment, we need Andy in  DC  He has my Strong Endorsement !
@Erik_Paulsen, @Jason2CD, 
@JimHagedornMN and @PeteStauber love our Country and the Great State of Minnesota .  They are winners and always get the job done .  We need them all in Congress for #MAGA .  Border, Military, Vets, 2nd A .  Go Vote Minnesota .  They have my Strong Endorsement !
Congressman @DaveBratVA7th is a fighter who is doing a great job for Virginia and for our Country .  Border, Military, Vets, 2nd Amendment and all else .  We need Dave in  DC  He has my Strong Endorsement !
@Erik_Paulsen, @Jason2CD, 
@JimHagedornMN and @PeteStauber love our Country and the Great State of Minnesota .  They are winners and always get the job done We need them all in Congress for #MAGA .  Border, Military, Vets, 2nd A .  Go Vote Minnesota .  They have my Strong Endorsement !
Congresswoman @cathymcmorris of Washington State is an incredible leader who is respected by everyone in Congress .  We need her badly in  DC  to keep building on #MAGA .  She has my Strong Endorsement !

@troybalderson is doing a great job as Congressman from Ohio .  We need him in  DC  Vote for Troy - He has my total Endorsement !
So Revealing !
I will be interviewed by Laura Ingraham  tonight at 10 : 00  PM  on @FoxNews
Check out tweets from last two days .  I refer to Fake News Media when mentioning Enemy of the People - but dishonest reporters use only the word Media .  The people of our Great Country are angry and disillusioned at receiving so much Fake News .  They get it, and fully understand !
CNN and others in the Fake News Business keep purposely and inaccurately reporting that I said the Media is the Enemy of the People .  Wrong !  I said that the Fake News (Media) is the Enemy of the People, a very big difference .  When you give out false information - not good !
Great job being done by Congressman Keith Rothfus of Pennsylvania .  Thank you Keith !
In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee, said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country !
Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border .  Please go back, you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process .  This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you !
Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, who won his race by a substantial margin .  We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade, Military and everything else !  Excellent call, wished him congrats !
… of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony .  Fake News Must End !
There is great anger in our Country caused in part by inaccurate, and even fraudulent, reporting of the news .  The Fake News Media, the true Enemy of the People, must stop the open & obvious hostility & report the news accurately & fairly .  That will do much to put out the flame …
The Fake News is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans, Conservatives and me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our Country .  Actually, it is their Fake & Dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand !
Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer, who I have not seen in action before, be interviewed by @jaketapper .  He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon .  As bad as their field is, if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive !
Thank you to Steve Rogers, FBI Joint Terror Task Force (Ret), for his very kind and generous remarks about me and my relationship to Law Enforcement .  @JudgeJeanine
Very interesting !
Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings .  It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings, Rich Hill of Dodgers, and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked .  4 run lead gone .  Managers do it all the time, big mistake !
… This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity .  It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world .  We must unite to conquer hate .
All of America is in mourning over the mass murder of Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh .  We pray for those who perished and their loved ones, and our hearts go out to the brave police officers who sustained serious injuries …
As you know, earlier today there was a horrific shooting targeting and killing Jewish Americans at the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania .  The shooter is in custody, and federal authorities have been dispatched to support state and local police …
Events in Pittsburgh are far more devastating than originally thought .  Spoke with Mayor and Governor to inform them that the Federal Government has been, and will be, with them all the way .  I will speak to the media shortly and make further statement at Future Farmers of America .
Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania .  Law enforcement on the scene .  People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered .  Looks like multiple fatalities .  Beware of active shooter .  God Bless All !
#Walkaway  Walkaway from the Democrat Party movement marches today in  DC  Congratulations to Brandon Straka for starting something very special .  @foxandfriends
Budd and Mark, two great patriots for Congress !
Martha McSally is a great warrior, her opponent a Nancy Pelosi Wacko !
Thank you Charlie !
Good luck Mary !
A big change is coming - don't want the Dems anymore !
Trump Thunders at Media for Smearing His Supporters after Bomb Scares   via @BreitbartNews
Fantastic evening in Charlotte, North Carolina with great PATRIOTS .  Get out and VOTE for @buddforcongress and @MarkHarrisNC9 !    #MAGARally replay :
If you meet every day with optimism – if you confront every obstacle with determination – if you refuse to give up, if you never quit, if you face every challenge with confidence and pride – then there is no goal you cannot achieve, and no dream beyond your reach !  #YBLS2018
It was my great honor, thank you !
Whether you are African-American, Hispanic-American or ANY AMERICAN at all – you have the right to live in a Country that puts YOUR NEEDS FIRST !
It is my great honor to be with so many brilliant, courageous, patriotic, and PROUD AMERICANS .  Seeing all of you here today fills me with extraordinary confidence in America's future .  Each of you is taking part in the Young Black Leadership Summit because you are true leaders …
I want to applaud the FBI, Secret Service, Department of Justice, the  US  Attorneys' Office for the Southern District of New York, the NYPD, and all Law Enforcement partners across the Country for their incredible work, skill and determination !
I would like to begin today's remarks by providing an update on the packages and devices that have been mailed to high-profile figures throughout our Country, and a media org .  I am pleased to inform you that law enforcement has apprehended the suspect and taken him into custody .
I will be speaking at the Young Black Leadership Summit in 15 minutes where I will address the investigation into the bomb packages .
Republicans are doing so well in early voting, and at the polls, and now this Bomb stuff happens and the momentum greatly slows - news not talking politics .  Very unfortunate, what is going on .  Republicans, go out and vote !
Twitter has removed many people from my account and, more importantly, they have seemingly done something that makes it much harder to join - they have stifled growth to a point where it is obvious to all .  A few weeks ago it was a Rocket Ship, now it is a Blimp !  Total Bias ?
The United States has been spending Billions of Dollars a year on Illegal Immigration .  This will not continue .  Democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws .  If not, we will be forced to play a much tougher hand .
Funny how lowly rated CNN, and others, can criticize me at will, even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing, yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream, it's just not Presidential !
The Service Members who died that day included brave young Marines just out of high school, accomplished officers in the middle of their military careers, and enlisted men who had served in theaters all over the world …
In 1983, roughly 1,800 Marines were in Beirut to keep the peace in a Nation torn apart by Civil War .  Terrorists had bombed the  US  Embassy earlier that year, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans …
We are gathered together on this solemn occasion to fulfill our most reverent and sacred duty .  35 years ago, 241 American service members were murdered in the terrorist attack on our Marine Barracks in Beirut, Lebanon .  Today, we honor our fallen heroes …
@BrucePoliquin from Maine is a great Congressman .  He is in a tough fight against a very liberal Nancy Pelosi Democrat .  Bruce has helped bring JOBS back to his State and totally protects your Great Second Amendment .  We need to keep Bruce in Washington .  He has my Full Endorsement !
@MikeDunleavyGov will make a fantastic Governor of Alaska .  Mike is for Energy and Jobs, is tough on Crime, loves our Vets and our Great Second Amendment .  Mike has my Complete and Total Endorsement !

… I agree with their stance 100%, and the United States is likewise taking a very hard line on illegal immigration .  The Prime Minister is working very hard on the economy of Italy - he will be successful !
Just spoke with Prime Minister @GiuseppeConteIT of Italy concerning many subjects, including the fact that Italy is now taking a very hard line on illegal immigration …
Spoke with French President @EmmanuelMacron this morning .  Discussed many topics including the very exciting upcoming visit to Paris where @FLOTUS Melania and I will attend the Armistice Day Centennial Commemoration !
To those in the Caravan, turnaround, we are not letting people into the United States illegally .  Go back to your Country and if you want, apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing !
Remarks by President Trump on a Year of Historic Progress and Action to Combat the Opioid Crisis
The New York Times has a new Fake Story that now the Russians and Chinese (glad they finally added China) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones .  Except that I rarely use a cellphone, & when I do it's government authorized .  I like Hard Lines .  Just more made up Fake News !
A very big part of the Anger we see today in our society is caused by the purposely false and inaccurate reporting of the Mainstream Media that I refer to as Fake News .  It has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description .  Mainstream Media must clean up its act, FAST !
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border .  MUST BE CHANDED, but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency .  They will be stopped !
The so-called experts on Trump over at the New York Times wrote a long and boring article on my cellphone usage that is so incorrect I do not have time here to correct it .  I only use Government Phones, and have only one seldom used government cell phone .  Story is soooo wrong !
Just leaving Wisconsin .  @ScottWalker and @LeahVukmir are fantastic people, badly needed for our Country !  #MAGA
Just arrived in Wisconsin to help two great people, @ScottWalker and @LeahVukmir !
The safety of the American People is my highest priority .  I have just concluded a briefing with the FBI, Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, and the  US  Secret Service …
I agree wholeheartedly !
Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions, Democrats will not !  Vote Republican .
Brian Kemp will be a GREAT Governor of Georgia .  Stacey Abrams will destroy the State .  Sooooo important, get out and VOTE for Brian !
We are a great Sovereign Nation .  We have Strong Borders and will never accept people coming into our Country illegally !
For those who want and advocate for illegal immigration, just take a good look at what has happened to Europe over the last 5 years .  A total mess !  They only wish they had that decision to make over again .
I agree with President Obama 100% !
Billions of dollars are, and will be, coming into United States coffers because of Tariffs .  Great also for negotiations - if a country won't give us a fair Trade Deal, we will institute Tariffs on them .  Used or not, jobs and businesses will be created .   US  respected again !
#JobsNotMobs

Congressman John Faso of New York has worked hard and smart .  Strong on Crime, Borders and our 2nd Amendment, John is respected by all .  Vote for John .  He has my complete and total Endorsement !
The people of Puerto Rico are wonderful but the inept politicians are trying to use the massive and ridiculously high amounts of hurricane/disaster funding to pay off other obligations .  The  US  will NOT  bail out long outstanding & unpaid obligations with hurricane relief money !
Jay Webber of New Jersey, running for Congress, is doing a great job against a person who is looking to raise Taxes substantially .  Jay wants big Tax Cuts and Changes .  A Harvard graduate and father of seven, Jay will be great for New Jersey and get the job done-and I will help !
Congressman Erik Paulsen of the Great State of Minnesota has done a fantastic job in cutting Taxes and Job Killing Regulations .  Hard working and very smart .  Keep Erik in Congress .  He has my Strong Endorsement !
We send our deepest condolences to @RepLouBarletta and the entire Barletta family, on the passing of his brother .  Lou has been working so hard despite this terrible situation for the people of Pennsylvania .  Our thoughts and prayers are with Lou and the entire Barletta family !
Today's Democrat Party would rather protect criminal aliens than AMERICAN CITIZENS - which is why the Democrats must be voted OUT of OFFICE !  #JobsNotMobs
At stake in this Election is whether we continue the extraordinary prosperity we have achieved - or whether we let the Radical Democrat Mob take a giant wrecking ball to our Country and our Economy !  #JobsNotMobs
We send our deepest condolences to Lou and the entire Barletta family - he has been working so hard despite this terrible situation for the people of Pennsylvania .  Our thoughts and prayers are with you Lou !
THANK YOU HOUSTON, TEXAS .  Get out and   #JobsNotMobs

Massive crowds inside and outside of the @ToyotaCenter in Houston, Texas .  Landing shortly - see everyone soon !  #MAGA🇺🇸
Let's go FLORIDA !
Last day to register to VOTE in Alabama, California, South Dakota and Wyoming !  #JobsNotMobs
WOW - thank you Houston, Texas !  I am departing @Andrews_JBA now .  See you in a few hours !  !  #MAGA🇺🇸
… I say of course they're low - because for the first time in 50 years I am making them pay a big price for doing business with America .  Why should they like me ?  — But I still like them !
The Fake News Media has been talking about recent approval ratings of me by countries around the world, including the European Union, as being very low …
America :  the Cleanest Air in the World - BY FAR !
Shock report :  US paying more for illegal immigrant births than Trump's wall
Big Night In Texas !  !  !  !
Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the  US  We will now begin cutting off, or substantially reducing, the massive foreign aid routinely given to them .
Every time you see a Caravan, or people illegally coming, or attempting to come, into our Country illegally, think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws !  Remember the Midterms !  So unfair to those who come in legally .
Sadly, it looks like Mexico's Police and Military are unable to stop the Caravan heading to the Southern Border of the United States .  Criminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in .  I have alerted Border Patrol and Military that this is a National Emergy .  Must change laws !
Congressman Tom Reed of New York's 23rd District has done a great job .  He has my complete and total Endorsement !
Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis had a great debate victory tonight against Andrew Gillum, a mayor who presides over one of the worst run, and most corrupt, cities in Florida .  Ron will build on the great job done by Governor Rick Scott .  Gillum will make Florida the next Venezuela !
Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to purge themselves of Fake News .  Does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business ?
Best Jobs Numbers in the history of our great Country !  Many other things likewise .  So why wouldn't we win the Midterms ?  Dems can never do even nearly as well !  Think of what will happen to your now beautiful 401-k's !
The Caravans are a disgrace to the Democrat Party .  Change the immigration laws NOW !
Full efforts are being made to stop the onslaught of illegal aliens from crossing our Souther Border .  People have to apply for asylum in Mexico first, and if they fail to do that, the  US  will turn them away .  The courts are asking the  US  to do things that are not doable !
Watched North Dakota's Rep .  Kevin Cramer easily win debate with Senator Heidi Heitkamp .  Great job Kevin, you will be a great Senator !
All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING .  Cheat at your own peril .  Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal !

Leaving Arizona after a fantastic Rally last night, in Mesa, honoring, and for, Martha @RepMcSally McSally .  She is an inspiration & will be a GREAT SENATOR for the people of Arizona .  Her opponent is a Nancy Pelosi puppet, really bad for State .  Early Voting NOW !  Will be back soon .
Rick Scott is known as easily one of the best Governors in the USA .  Florida is setting records in almost every category of success .  Amazing achievement-the envy of the World .  Ron DeSantis will build on this success .  His incompetent opponent will destroy Florida - next Venezuela !
Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis is working hard .  A great Congressman and top student at Harvard & Yale, Ron will be a record setting governor for Florida .  Rick Scott gave him tremendous foundations to further build on .  His opponent runs one of the worst & most corrupt cities in USA !
Get out and Early Vote for Brian Kemp .  He will be a GREAT GOVERNOR for the State of Georgia !
Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp will be a great governor .  He has been successful at whatever he has done, and has prepared for this very difficult and complex job for many years .  He has my Strong Endorsement .  His opponent is totally unqualified .  Would destroy a great state !
If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together, we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour .  Look at the needless  pain and suffering that they are causing .  Look at the horrors taking place on the Border .  Chuck & Nancy, call me !
Beautiful evening in Mesa, Arizona with GREAT PATRIOTS - thank you !    #MAGARally🇺🇸replay :

This is what it is all about for the Republican Party !  #JobsNotMobs
#JobsNotMobs !
Beto O'Rourke is a total lightweight compared to Ted Cruz, and he comes nowhere near representing the values and desires of the people of the Great State of Texas .  He will never be allowed to turn Texas into Venezuela !
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was never given or shown a Transcript or Video of the Saudi Consulate event .  FAKE NEWS !
When referring to the USA, I will always capitalize the word Country !
Congressman Andy Biggs is doing a great job for Arizona and our Country !
#JobsNotMobs !
Jon Tester says one thing to voters and does the EXACT OPPOSITE in Washington .  Tester takes his orders form Pelosi & Schumer .  Tester wants to raise your taxes, take away your 2A, open your borders, and deliver MOB RULE .  Retire Tester & Elect America-First Patriot Matt Rosendale !
Thank you Missoula, Montana .  Get out and VOTE for @MattForMontana and @GregForMontana !  !  #MAGA🇺🇸
The only thing keeping Tester alive is he has millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and leftists, who couldn't care less about our Country !
Will be landing soon .  Looking forward to seeing our next Senator from Montana, Matt Rosendale .  He will represent our Country well, far better than Jon Tester who will vote with Cryin' Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi - never with us !
Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan has been working with me to help balance out the one-sided Trade with Japan .  These are some of the investments they are making in our Country - just the beginning !
Thank you Mexico, we look forward to working with you !
Look forward to being there .  Something's happening !  #MAGA
Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country ?
All Republicans support people with pre-existing conditions, and if they don't, they will after I speak to them .  I am in total support .  Also, Democrats will destroy your Medicare, and I will keep it healthy and well !
See you tonight Missoula, Montana !  #MAGARally🇺🇸
@StateDept @SecPompeo outside of the West Wing after our meeting this morning in the Oval Office …
… the Crown Prince .  He is waiting for the results of the investigations being done by the Saudis and Turkey, and just gave a news conference to that effect .
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo returned last night from Saudi Arabia and Turkey .  I met with him this morning wherein the Saudi situation was discussed in great detail, including his meeting with …
Congressman @DaveBratVA7th is one of the hardest working, and smartest, people in Washington .  He is strong on the Border, Crime, the Military, our Vets and the 2nd Amendment .  He is a powerful vote for MAGA and loves the Great State of Virginia .  Dave has my Total Endorsement !
… The assault on our country at our Southern Border, including the Criminal elements and DRUGS pouring in, is far more important to me, as President, than Trade or the USMCA .  Hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their Northern Border .  All Democrats fault for weak laws !
… In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the  US  Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER !  .  .
I am watching the Democrat Party led (because they want Open Borders and existing weak laws) assault on our country by Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, whose leaders are doing little to stop this large flow of people, INCLUDING MANY CRIMINALS, from entering Mexico to U . S …
Ever since his vicious and totally false statements about Admiral Ron Jackson, the highly respected White House Doctor for Obama, Bush & me, Senator John Tester looks to be in big trouble in the Great State of Montana !  He behaved worse than the Democrat Mob did with Justice K !
This afternoon, it was my great honor to present @USMC Sergeant Major John Canley the Medal of Honor in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse !
Congressman Neal Dunn (@DunnCampaign) of Florida has done an outstanding job at everything having to do with #MAGA .  Now working hard on hurricane relief and rebuild .  Strong on Crime, strong on Borders, loves our Military and our Vets .  Neal has my highest Endorsement !
College educated women want safety, security and healthcare protections – very much along with financial and economic health for themselves and our Country .  I supply all of this far better than any Democrat (for decades, actually) .  That's why they will be voting for me !

Republicans must make the horrendous, weak and outdated immigration laws, and the Border, a part of the Midterms !
Hard to believe that with thousands of people from South of the Border, walking unimpeded toward our country in the form of large Caravans, that the Democrats won't approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country .  Great Midterm issue for Republicans !

August job openings hit a record 7 . 14 million .  Congratulations USA !
AP headline was very different from my quote and meaning in the story .  They just can't help themselves .  FAKE NEWS !
Ted Cruz has done so much for Texas, including massive cuts in taxes and regulations - which has brought Texas to the best jobs numbers in the history of the state .  He watches carefully over your 2nd Amendment .  O'Rourke would blow it all !  Ted has long had my Strong Endorsement !
Watched the debate last night & Beto O'Rourke, who wants higher taxes and far more regulations, is not in the same league with Ted Cruz & what the great people of Texas stand for & want .  Ted is strong on Crime, Border & 2nd A, loves our Military, Vets, Low Taxes .  Beto is a Flake !
Trump could be the most honest president in modern history .  When you look at the real barometer of presidential truthfulness, which is promise keeping, he is probably the most honest president in American history .  He's done exactly what he said he would do .  Marc Thiessen, WPost
Stock Market up 548 points today .  Also, GREAT jobs numbers !
Elizabeth Warren is being hammered, even by the Left .  Her false claim of Indian heritage is only selling to VERY LOW I . Q .  individuals !
Anybody entering the United States illegally will be arrested and detained, prior to being sent back to their country !
We have today informed the countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens, or others, to journey through their borders and up to the United States, with the intention of entering our country illegally, all payments made to them will STOP (END) !
I will be interviewed tonight by Trish Regan on @FoxBusiness at 8 : 00  PM , right after the great Lou Dobbs !
WOW, John James is making headway in Michigan .  We are bringing jobs back to the State, and the People of Michigan appreciate it .  Debbie Stabenow has been no help, if anything, a major hindrance .  John James is a star, I hope the voters see it .  Polls are tightening !
… during the call, and told me that he has already started, and will rapidly expand, a full and complete investigation into this matter .  Answers will be forthcoming shortly .
Just spoke with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia who totally denied any knowledge of what took place in their Turkish Consulate .  He was with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo …

Is it really possible that Bruce Ohr, whose wife Nellie was paid by Simpson and GPS Fusion for work done on the Fake Dossier, and who was used as a Pawn in this whole SCAM (WITCH HUNT), is still working for the Department of Justice ?  ?  ?  ?  ?  Can this really be so ?  ?  ?  ?  ?
Conflict between Glen Simpson's testimony to another House Panel about his contact with Justice Department official Bruce Ohr .  Ohr was used by Simpson and Steele as a Back Channel to get (FAKE) Dossier to FBI .  Simpson pleading Fifth .  Catherine Herridge .  Where is Jeff Sessions ?
Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials lawsuit versus Trump .  Trump is entitled to full legal fees .  @FoxNews Great, now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas .  She will confirm the letter she signed !  She knows nothing about me, a total con !

Op-Ed praises Trump Administrations efforts at the Border .  @FoxNews  The  Washington Examiner States, Finally, the government has taken steps to stop releasing unaccompanied minors to criminals and traffickers .  This was done by the Obama Administration !
Thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, is a complete and total Fraud !
Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie, Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public .  Harvard called her a person of color (amazing con), and would not have taken her otherwise !
Pocahontas (the bad version), sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren, is getting slammed .  She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024, far less than the average American .  Now Cherokee Nation denies her, DNA test is useless .  Even they don't want her .  Phony !
TOGETHER, WE WILL PREVAIL !
Open enrollment starts today on lower-priced Medicare Advantage plans so loved by our great seniors .  Crazy Bernie and his band of Congressional Dems will outlaw these plans .  Disaster !
Just arrived in Florida .  Also thinking about our GREAT Alabama farmers and our many friends in North and South Carolina today .  We are with you !
On our way to Florida and Georgia !
Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened to our Saudi Arabian citizen .  He said that they are working closely with Turkey to find answer .  I am immediately sending our Secretary of State to meet with King !
Will be leaving for Florida and Georgia with the First Lady to tour the hurricane damage and visit with FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement .  Maximum effort is taking place, everyone is working very hard .  Worst hit in 50 years !
The crowds at my Rallies are far bigger than they have ever been before, including the 2016 election .  Never an empty seat in these large venues, many thousands of people watching screens outside .  Enthusiasm & Spirit is through the roof .  SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING - WATCH !

Princess Eugenie of York was a truly beautiful bride yesterday .  She has been through so much, and has come out a total winner !
NBC News has totally and purposely changed the point and  meaning of my story about General Robert E Lee and General Ulysses Grant .  Was actually a shoutout to warrior Grant and the great state in which he was born .  As usual, dishonest reporting .  Even mainstream media embarrassed !
Congratulations to Tucker Carlson on the great success of his book, Ship of Fools .  It just went to NUMBER ONE !
Big day !  Pastor Andrew Brunson, who could have spent 35 years in a Turkish prison, was returned safely home to his family today .  Met in Oval Office, great people !  Then off to Kentucky for a Rally for Congressman Andy Barr .  Tremendous crowd & spirit !  Just returned to White House .
Thank you Kentucky !  #MAGA🇺🇸

WELCOME HOME PASTOR ANDREW BRUNSON !

Heading to the Great State of Kentucky - Big Rally for Congressman Andy Barr - Fantastic guy, need his vote for MAGA !  Strong on Crime, Tax Cuts, Military, Vets & 2nd A .  His opponent will NEVER vote for us, only for Pelosi .  Andy has my Strongest Endorsement !  !  !  See you in Kentucky .
Highly respected Congressman Keith Rothfus (R) of Pennsylvania is in the fight of his life because the Dems changed the District Map .  He must win .  Strong on crime, borders, big tax & reg cuts, Military & Vets .  Opponent Lamb a Pelosi puppet-weak on crime .  BIG ENDORSEMENT FOR KEITH
From a Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours .   Kristin Fisher of @FoxNews   Very cool !
There was NO DEAL made with Turkey for the release and return of Pastor Andrew Brunson .  I don't make deals for hostages .  There was, however, great appreciation on behalf of the United States, which will lead to good, perhaps great, relations between the United States & Turkey !
Pastor Andrew Brunson, released by Turkey, will be with me in the Oval Office at 2 : 30  PM  (this afternoon) .  It will be wonderful to see and meet him .  He is a great Christian who has been through such a tough experience .  I would like to thank President @RT_Erdogan for his help !
Happy 243rd Birthday to our GREAT @USNavy !  #243NavyBday

We are with you Florida !
Despite so many positive events and victories, Media Reseach Center reports that 92% of stories on Donald Trump are negative on ABC, CBS and ABC .  It is FAKE NEWS !  Don't worry, the Failing New York Times didn't even put the Brett Kavanaugh victory on the Front Page yesterday-A17 !

Great evening last night at the White House honoring Justice Kavanaugh and family .  Our country is very proud of them !
The paid  DC  protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven't gotten their checks - in other words, they weren't paid !  Screamers in Congress, and outside, were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills !


Great to see @AGPamBondi launch a cutting-edge statewide school safety APP in Florida today - named by Parkland Survivors .  BIG PRIORITY and Florida is getting it done !  #FortifyFL
Every day, our police officers race into darkened allies, deserted streets, & onto the doorsteps of the most hardened criminals .  They see the worst of humanity & they respond with the best of the American Spirit .  America's LEOs have earned the everlasting gratitude of our Nation !

Beautiful evening in Topeka, Kansas .  VOTE, VOTE, VOTE !  #MAGA
Thank you Kansas - I love you !
The crowd in front of the  US  Supreme Court is tiny, looks like about 200 people (& most are onlookers) - that wouldn't even fill the first couple of rows of our Kansas Rally, or any of our Rallies for that matter !  The Fake News Media tries to make it look sooo big, & it's not !
I applaud and congratulate the  US  Senate for confirming our GREAT NOMINEE, Judge Brett Kavanaugh, to the United States Supreme Court .  Later today, I will sign his Commission of Appointment, and he will be officially sworn in .  Very exciting !
I have asked Steve Daines, our great Republican Senator from Montana, to attend his daughter Annie's wedding rather than coming to today's vote .  Steve was ready to do whatever he had to, but we had the necessary number .  To the Daines Family, congratulations-have a wonderful day !
Women for Kavanaugh, and many others who support this very good man, are gathering all over Capitol Hill in preparation for a 3-5  PM  VOTE .  It is a beautiful thing to see - and they are not paid professional protesters who are handed expensive signs .  Big day for America !

This is now the 7th .  time the FBI has investigated Judge Kavanaugh .  If we made it 100, it would still not be good enough for the Obstructionist Democrats .

Our country's great First Lady, Melania, is doing really well in Africa .  The people love her, and she loves them !  It is a beautiful thing to see .
The harsh and unfair treatment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh is having an incredible upward impact on voters .  The PEOPLE get it far better than the politicians .  Most importantly, this great life cannot be ruined by mean & despicable Democrats and totally uncorroborated allegations !
Wow, such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh .  Look at the Energy, look at the Polls .  Something very big is happening .  He is a fine man and great intellect .  The country is with him all the way !
My thoughts and prayers are with the Florence County Sheriff's Office and the Florence Police Department tonight, in South Carolina .  We are forever grateful for what our Law Enforcement Officers do 24/7/365 .

The Stock Market just reached an All-Time High during my Administration for the 102nd Time, a presidential record, by far, for less than two years .  So much potential as Trade and Military Deals are completed .
The Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before .  They used the concept of time value of money in doing a very old, boring and often told hit piece on me .  Added up, this means that 97% of their stories on me are bad .  Never recovered from bad election call !
Congressman @PeteSessions of Texas is a true fighter and patriot .  Highly respected in  DC  by all, he always gets what his district, and our country, wants and needs .  Strong on Crime, Border, Military, Vets and 2nd Amendment .  Pete has my Full and Total Endorsement .  A great guy !
Thank you Mississippi - Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !

Late last night, our deadline, we reached a wonderful new Trade Deal with Canada, to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico .  The new name will be The United States Mexico Canada Agreement, or USMCA .  It is a great deal for all three countries, solves the many …
Wow !  Just starting to hear the Democrats, who are only thinking Obstruct and Delay, are starting to put out the word that the time and scope of FBI looking into Judge Kavanaugh and witnesses is not enough .  Hello !  For them, it will never be enough - stay tuned and watch !
So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history, median income the highest, and you then add all of the other things I have done, how do Democrats, who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK, win the Black Vote ?   And it will only get better !
Like many, I don't watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny, no talent or charm .  It is just a political ad for the Dems .  Word is that Kanye West, who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told no), was great .  He's leading the charge !
NBC News incorrectly reported (as usual) that I was limiting the FBI investigation of Judge Kavanaugh, and witnesses, only to certain people .  Actually, I want them to interview whoever they deem appropriate, at their discretion .  Please correct your reporting !
Thank you West Virginia - I love you !

Heading to West Virginia now .  Big Rally .  Will be live on @FoxNews tonight .  Long lines, but will be great !
Senator Richard Blumenthal must talk about his fraudulent service in Vietnam, where for 12 years he told the people of Connecticut, as their Attorney General, that he was a great Marine War Hero .  Talked about his many battles of near death, but was never in Vietnam .  Total Phony !
Just started, tonight, our 7th FBI investigation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh .  He will someday be recognized as a truly great Justice of The United States Supreme Court !
Judge Kavanaugh showed America exactly why I nominated him .  His testimony was powerful, honest, and riveting .  Democrats' search and destroy strategy is disgraceful and this process has been a total sham and effort to delay, obstruct, and resist .  The Senate must vote !

Join me this Saturday in Wheeling, West Virginia at 7pmE !  Tickets :

China is actually placing propaganda ads in the Des Moines Register and other papers, made to look like news .  That's because we are beating them on Trade, opening markets, and the farmers will make a fortune when this is over !
Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations, like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh .  He is just looking for attention and doesn't want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life !
Jobless Claims fell to their lowest level in 49 years !
Consumer confidence hits an 18 year high, close to breaking the all-time record .  A big jump from last 8 years .  People are excited about the USA again !  We are getting Bigger and Richer and Stronger .  WAY MORE TO GO !
The Democrats are playing a high level CON GAME in their vicious effort to destroy a fine person .  It is called the politics of destruction .  Behind the scene the Dems are laughing .  Pray for Brett Kavanaugh and his family !

Despite requests, I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani .  Maybe someday in the future .  I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man !
Republican Party Favorability is the highest it has been in 7 years - 3 points higher than Democrats !   Gallup
The Democrats are working hard to destroy a wonderful man, and a man who has the potential to be one of our greatest Supreme Court Justices ever, with an array of False Accusations the likes of which have never been seen before !
REMEMBER THE MIDTERMS !

Remarks by President Trump at the Signing of H . R .  5895 :

Promises Kept for our GREAT Veterans !
Throughout American history, the men and women of our Armed Forces have selflessly served our Country, making tremendous sacrifices to defend our liberty .  On National POW/MIA Recognition Day, we honor all American Prisoners of War :
Senator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months, only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay .  Let her testify, or not, and TAKE THE VOTE !

… has been asked to review these documents on an expedited basis .  I believe he will move quickly on this (and hopefully other things which he is looking at) .  In the end I can always declassify if it proves necessary .  Speed is very important to me - and everyone !
I met with the DOJ concerning the declassification of various UNREDACTED documents .  They agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the Russia probe .  Also, key Allies' called to ask not to release .  Therefore, the Inspector General …
The radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW .  Why didn't someone call the FBI 36 years ago ?
I will Chair the United Nations Security Council meeting on Iran next week !
I have no doubt that, if the attack on Dr .  Ford was as bad as she says, charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents .  I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date, time, and place !
Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man, with an impeccable reputation, who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don't want to know the answers, they just want to destroy and delay .  Facts don't matter .  I go through this with them every single day in  DC
AMERICA IS WINNING AGAIN !

I want to know, where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill, and where will it come from after the Midterms ?  Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security .  REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH !
… The thing that's lacking is we can't properly secure the Border because of the Democrats historic level of Obstruction .  Senator David Perdue of Georgia .
We can't secure the Border because of the Democrats historic level of Obstruction .  The Presidents fed up with this .  His agenda is working .  The economy is growing at twice the rate it did under Obama .  We've nominated and confirmed 68 Federal Judges, 26 Court of Appeals Judges …
We protect the countries of the Middle East, they would not be safe for very long without us, and yet they continue to push for higher and higher oil prices !  We will remember .  The OPEC monopoly must get prices down now !
Financial and jobs numbers are fantastic .  There are plenty of new, high paying jobs available in our great and very vibrant economy .  If you are not happy where you are, start looking - but also remember, our economy is only getting better .  Vote in Midterms !

Great new book by Jason Chaffetz appropriately called The Deep State .  Very interesting indeed !
Just returned to the White House from the Great States of North Carolina and South Carolina where incredible work is being done on the ongoing fight against hurricane Florence .  Tremendous talent and spirit !

The recovery got started on Election Day 2016 .  It took Trump's Tax Cuts and Regulation Cuts to get the economy booming .  Before that it was the worst and slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression .  It took just 6 months for Trump to get to 3%, even though they said …

Thank you to our great Coast Guard for doing such a tremendous job - thousands of lives being saved !
… that FEMA, our Military, and our First Responders, who are all unbelievable, are a disaster and not doing a good job .  This will be a total lie, but that's what they do, and everybody knows it !
Right now, everybody is saying what a great job we are doing with Hurricane Florence – and they are 100% correct .  But don't be fooled, at some point in the near future the Democrats will start ranting …
Happy 71st Birthday to our GREAT United States Air Force !
… China has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade for many years .  They also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it .  There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers, ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted !
China has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers, ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me .  What China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that …

Immediately after Comey's firing Peter Strzok texted to his lover, Lisa Page We need to Open the case we've been waiting on now while Andy (McCabe, also fired) is acting .  Page answered, We need to lock in (redacted) .  In a formal chargeable way .  Soon .  Wow, a conspiracy caught ?
Lisa Page Testimony- NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BEFORE MUELLER APPOINTMENT .  @FoxNews by Catherine Herridge .  Therefore, the case should never have been allowed to be brought .  It is a totally illegal Witch Hunt !
Our Steel Industry is the talk of the World .  It has been given new life, and is thriving .  Billions of Dollars is being spent on new plants all around the country !
Tariffs have put the  US  in a very strong bargaining position, with Billions of Dollars, and Jobs, flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable .  If countries will not make fair deals with us, they will be Tariffed !
A lot of small & medium size enterprises are registering very good profit, sometimes record profits-there stocks are doing very well, low income workers are getting big raises .  There are an awful lot of good things going on that weren't during Pres .  Obama's Watch .  Peter Morici
Consumer Sentiment hit its highest level in 17 years this year .  Sentiment fell 11% in 2015, an Obama year, and rose 16% since the Election, #TrumpTime !
Best economic numbers in decades .  If the Democrats take control, kiss your newfound wealth goodbye !
Watch @MariaBartiromo at 6 : 00  PM  on @FoxBusiness .  Russian Hoax the big topic !  Mainstream Media, often referred to as the Fake News Media, hates to discuss the real facts !
Congratulations to all of our Mexican friends on National Independence Day .  We will be doing great things together !
Just watched Sunday Morning Futures with @MariaBartiromo on @FoxNews .  This show is MANDATORY watching if you want to understand the massive governmental corruption and the Russian Hoax .  It will be rebroadcast this evening at 6 : 00  PM  on @FoxBusiness .  A must see !
FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are working really hard on hurricane Florence .  As the storm begins to finally recede, they will kick into an even higher gear .  Very Professional !
The illegal Mueller Witch Hunt continues in search of a crime .  There was never Collusion with Russia, except by the Clinton campaign, so the 17 Angry Democrats are looking at anything they can find .  Very unfair and BAD for the country .  ALSO, not allowed under the LAW !
Exclusive -- Donald Trump Jr .  to Obama :  My Dad Fixed the Economy You Could Not   via @BreitbartNews
Five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to hurricane Florence !  Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims .  May God be with them !
When will Republican leadership learn that they are being played like a fiddle by the Democrats on Border Security and Building the Wall ?  Without Borders, we don't have a country .  With Open Borders, which the Democrats want, we have nothing but crime !  Finish the Wall !
While my (our) poll numbers are good, with the Economy being the best ever, if it weren't for the Rigged Russian Witch Hunt, they would be 25 points higher !  Highly conflicted Bob Mueller & the 17 Angry Democrats are using this Phony issue to hurt us in the Midterms .  No Collusion !
@DannyTarkanian of Nevada is a great friend who supports the Trump Agenda .  He is Strong on Crime, the Border and our under siege 2nd Amendment .  Danny Loves our Military and our Vets .  He has my total and complete Endorsement !

We (@FEMA) have never had the support that we have had from this President .

Thank you @nycemergencymgt !
When President Obama said that he has been to 57 States, very little mention in Fake News Media .  Can you imagine if I said that … story of the year !  @IngrahamAngle
… GWU Research to tell them how many people had died in Puerto Rico (how would they not know this ? ) .  This method was never done with previous hurricanes because other jurisdictions know how many people were killed .  FIFTY TIMES LAST ORIGINAL NUMBER - NO WAY !
When Trump visited the island territory last October, OFFICIALS told him in a briefing 16 PEOPLE had died from Maria .  The Washington Post .  This was long AFTER the hurricane took place .  Over many months it went to 64 PEOPLE .  Then, like magic, 3000 PEOPLE KILLED .  They hired …
Great job FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement - not easy, very dangerous, tremendous talent .  America is proud of you .  Keep it all going - finish strong !
My thoughts and prayers are with 
Evelyn Rodriguez this evening, along with her family and friends .  #RIPEvelyn
The story of Puerto Rico is the rebuilding that has occurred .  The President has done an extraordinary job of cleanup, rebuilding electrical stuff and everything else .   @EdRollins   The people of Puerto Rico have one of the most corrupt governments in our country .  @LouDobbs
They say all these people died in the storm in Puerto Rico, yet 70% of the power was out before the storm .  So when did people start dying ?  At what point do you recognize that what they are doing is a political agenda couched in the nice language of journalism ?   @GeraldoRivera
Keep up the great work - THANK YOU !
We love the #CajunNavy - THANK YOU !  #FlorenceHurricane2018
Incredible job being done by FEMA, First Responders, Law Enforcement and all .  Thank you !
Gina is Great !
John Kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile Iranian Regime, which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the American people .  He told them to wait out the Trump Administration !  Was he registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act ?  BAD !
Senator Debbie Stabenow and the Democrats are totally against approving the Farm Bill .  They are fighting tooth and nail to not allow our Great Farmers to get what they so richly deserve .  Work requirements are imperative and the Dems are a NO .  Not good !
Thank you @USNationalGuard !  #HurricaneFlorence
I was just briefed on Hurricane Florence .  FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready .  We are with you !
Thank you @USCG !
The Wall Street Journal has it wrong, we are under no pressure to make a deal with China, they are under pressure to make a deal with us .  Our markets are surging, theirs are collapsing .  We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home .  If we meet, we meet ?
… This was done by the Democrats in order to make me look as bad as possible when I was successfully raising Billions of Dollars to help rebuild Puerto Rico .  If a person died for any reason, like old age, just add them onto the list .  Bad politics .  I love Puerto Rico !
3000 people did not die in the two hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico .  When I left the Island, AFTER the storm had hit, they had anywhere from 6 to 18 deaths .  As time went by it did not go up by much .  Then, a long time later, they started to report really large numbers, like 3000 …
Middle-Class Income Hits All-Time High !  @foxandfriends  And will continue to rise (unless the Dems get in and destroy what we have built) .
… It is a cesspool of corruption, and the people who did this need to be brought to justice .   @GreggJarrett
More text messages between former FBI employees Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are a disaster and embarrassment to the FBI & DOJ .  This should never have happened but we are learning more and more by the hour .  Others were leaking like mad in order to get the President !   …
We are completely ready for hurricane Florence, as the storm gets even larger and more powerful .  Be careful !
The problem with banker Jamie Dimon running for President is that he doesn't have the aptitude or smarts & is a poor public speaker & nervous mess - otherwise he is wonderful .  I've made a lot of bankers, and others, look much smarter than they are with my great economic policy !
Tonight, it was my great honor to host a Congressional Medal of Honor Society Reception at the @WhiteHouse !

Hurricane Florence may now be dipping a bit south and hitting a portion of the Great State of Georgia .  Be ready, be prepared !

Hurricane Florence is looking even bigger than anticipated .  It will be arriving soon .  FEMA, First Responders and Law Enforcement are supplied and ready .  Be safe !
We got A Pluses for our recent hurricane work in Texas and Florida (and did an unappreciated great job in Puerto Rico, even though an inaccessible island with very poor electricity and a totally incompetent Mayor of San Juan) .  We are ready for the big one that is coming !
The President has absolutely demonstrated no wrongdoing whatsoever & that the Special Counsel has no evidence of any wrongdoing .  In other words, it's time to end this Witch Hunt .  @LouDobbs   Russian collusion was just an excuse by the Democrats for having lost the Election !
Crazy Maxine Waters :  After we impeach Trump, we'll go after Mike Pence .  We'll get him .   @FoxNews  Where are the Democrats coming from ?  The best Economy in the history of our country would totally collapse if they ever took control !
… giving the information, and causing the appointment of a Special C without having the courage of his own convictions …   Alan Dershowitz   @TuckerCarlson   In other words, the whole thing was illegally and very unfairly set up ?

President Trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% GDP, stated President Obama .  I guess I have a magic wand, 4 . 2%, and we will do MUCH better than this !  We have just begun .
The Economy is soooo good, perhaps the best in our country's history (remember, it's the economy stupid ! ), that the Democrats are flailing & lying like CRAZY !  Phony books, articles and T . V .  hits like no other pol has had to endure-and they are losing big .  Very dishonest people !
It is mostly anonymous sources in here, why should anyone trust you ?  General Mattis, General Kelly said it's not true .  @SavannahGuthrie  @TODAYshow  Bob Woodward is a liar who is like a Dem operative prior to the Midterms .  He was caught cold, even by NBC .
I'm taking this book with a grain of salt & everyone should do the same .  Multiple sources, but almost every one of them has come out and discredited the claims made by Woodward .  You cannot take this book too seriously .  Katelyn Caralle, Washington Examiner
The White House is a smooth running machine .  We are making some of the biggest and most important deals in our country's history - with many more to come !  The Dems are going crazy !
The White House is running beautifully .  We are making some of the greatest and most important deals in our countries history - with many more to come .  Big progress !
The Woodward book is a Joke - just another assault against me, in a barrage of assaults, using now disproven unnamed and anonymous sources .  Many have already come forward to say the quotes by them, like the book, are fiction .  Dems can't stand losing .  I'll write the real book !
If the Democrats had won the Election in 2016, GDP, which was about 1% and going down, would have been minus 4% instead of up 4 . 2% .  I opened up our beautiful economic engine with Regulation and Tax Cuts .  Our system was choking and would have been made worse .  Still plenty to do !
The GDP Rate (4 . 2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3 . 9%) for the first time in over 100 years !
Melania and I wish all Jewish people Shana Tova and send our warmest greetings to those celebrating Rosh Hashanah and the start of the High Holy Days …

North Korea has just staged their parade, celebrating 70th anniversary of founding, without the customary display of nuclear missiles .  Theme was peace and economic development .  Experts believe that North Korea cut out the nuclear missiles to show President Trump …
Wow, NFL first game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison .  Viewership declined 13%, the lowest in over a decade .  If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem, and it is all shown on broadcast, maybe ratings could come back ?  Otherwise worse !
Trump has set Economic Growth on fire .  During his time in office, the economy has achieved feats most experts thought impossible .  GDP is growing at a 3 percent-plus rate .  The unemployment rate is near a 50 year low .  CNBC … Also, the Stock Market is up almost 50% since Election !
If the  US  sells a car into China, there is a tax of 25% .  If China sells a car into the  US , there is a tax of 2% .  Does anybody think that is FAIR ?  The days of the  US  being ripped-off by other nations is OVER !

The Dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun .  But if I'm all of those terrible things, how come I beat them so badly, 306-223 ?  Maybe they're just not very good !  The fact is they are going CRAZY only because they know they can't beat me in 2020 !
Republicans are doing really well with the Senate Midterms .  Races that we were not even thinking about winning are now very close, or even leading .  Election night will be very interesting indeed !

Under our horrible immigration laws, the Government is frequently blocked from deporting criminal aliens with violent felony convictions .  House GOP just passed a bill to increase our ability to deport violent felons (Crazy Dems opposed) .  Need to get this bill to my desk fast !
The Woodward book is a scam .  I don't talk the way I am quoted .  If I did I would not have been elected President .  These quotes were made up .  The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle .  I wish the people could see the real facts - and our country is doing GREAT !

Thank you Montana, I love you !
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !

Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts .  I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way ?  As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG !
The Trump Economy is booming with help of House and Senate GOP .  #FarmBill with SNAP work  requirements will bolster farmers and get America back to work .  Pass the Farm Bill with SNAP work requirements !
Almost everyone agrees that my Administration has done more in less than two years than any other Administration in the history of our Country .  I'm tough as hell on people & if I weren't, nothing would get done .  Also, I question everybody & everything-which is why I got elected !
Isn't it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost .  Don't know why Washington politicians don't change libel laws ?
Secretary Mattis Nukes Woodward Allegations
Jim Mattis Calls Woodward Book 'Fiction' :  'Product of Someone's Rich Imagination'   via @BreitbartNews
The already discredited Woodward book, so many lies and phony sources, has me calling Jeff Sessions mentally retarded and a dumb southerner .  I said NEITHER, never used those terms on anyone, including Jeff, and being a southerner is a GREAT thing .  He made this up to divide !
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake NBC News said it's time for the Press to stop complaining and to start fighting back .  Actually Chuck, they've been doing that from the day I announced for President .  They've gone all out, and I WON, and now they're going CRAZY !
The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly .  Their quotes were made up frauds, a con on the public .  Likewise other stories and quotes .  Woodward is a Dem operative ?  Notice timing ?
Statement from White House @PressSec, Sarah Sanders :
Statement from White House Chief of Staff, General John Kelly :
Statement from Secretary of Defense, James Mattis :
Judge Brett Kavanaugh is an Exceptionally Qualified and Deserving Nominee for the Supreme Court
Paul Cook is a decorated Marine Corps Veteran who loves and supports our Military and Vets .  He is Strong on Crime, the Border, and supported Tax Cuts for the people of California .  Paul has my total and complete Endorsement !
Pledge to America's Workers
… looking to inflict pain and embarrassment to one of the most highly renowned jurists to ever appear before Congress .  So sad to see !
The Brett Kavanaugh hearings for the future Justice of the Supreme Court are truly a display of how mean, angry, and despicable the other side is .  They will say anything, and are only …
Jon Kyl will be an extraordinary Senator representing an extraordinary state, Arizona .  I look forward to working with him !
Everyone in the path of #Gordon please heed the advice of State and local officials and follow @NHC_Atlantic for updates .  The Federal Government stands ready to assist .  Be safe !
NBC FAKE NEWS, which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story, is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct .  I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN .  Look at their license ?
President Bashar al-Assad of Syria must not recklessly attack Idlib Province .  The Russians and Iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy .  Hundreds of thousands of people could be killed .  Don't let that happen !
According to the Failing New York Times, the FBI started a major effort to flip Putin loyalists in 2014-2016 .  It wasn't about Trump, he wasn't even close to a candidate yet .   Rigged Witch Hunt !
I see that John Kerry, the father of the now terminated Iran deal, is thinking of running for President .  I should only be so lucky - although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME !
… The Democrats, none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions, must love him now .  Same thing with Lyin' James Comey .  The Dems all hated him, wanted him out, thought he was disgusting - UNTIL I FIRED HIM !  Immediately he became a wonderful man, a saint like figure in fact .  Really sick !
Two long running, Obama era, investigations of  two very popular Republican Congressmen were brought to a well publicized charge, just ahead of the Mid-Terms, by the Jeff Sessions Justice Department .  Two easy wins now in doubt because there is not enough time .  Good job Jeff …
The  US  is respected again !
Richard Trumka, the head of the AFL-CIO, represented his union poorly on television this weekend .  Some of the things he said were so against the working men and women of our country, and the success of the  US  itself, that it is easy to see why unions are doing so poorly .  A Dem !
The Worker in America is doing better than ever before .  Celebrate Labor Day !
Happy Labor Day !  Our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows .  The  US  has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst Trade Deals ever made by any country in the world .  Big progress being made !

… The fact is that African/American unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country .  Same with Asian, Hispanic and almost every other group .  The Democrats have been all talk and no action .  My Administration has already produced like no other, and everyone sees it !
Tiger Woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the Office of the Presidency and me .  Now they say the so-called left is angry at him .  So sad, but the center & right loves Tiger, Kanye, George Foreman, Jim Brown & so many other greats, even more …
There is no possible way the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump jr and a couple of Russians, who have very deep connections to both the Clintons & Fusion GPS, & where no information on the Clintons was exchanged, is a crime .  Dems are blinded by their hatred of Trump .  Bongino
No information was ever given by the Trump Team to Russia, yet the Hillary Clinton campaign paid for information from Kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary, Christopher Steele .   Jesse Waters
… positions of power .  That's part of the story of the Russia Hoax .  Christopher Steele is on the payroll of Hillary Clinton & the FBI, & when they fired him for lying, they continued to use him .  Violation of FBI regulations .  Kept trying to verify the unverifiable .  @GreggJarrett
There's no fairness here, if you're a Democrat or a friend of Hillary you get immunity or off scott free .  If you're connected to Donald Trump, you get people like Robert Mueller & Andrew Weissman, and his team of partisans, coming after you with a vengeance and abusing their …
We shouldn't have to buy our friends with bad Trade Deals and Free Military Protection !

No Deal !  Trade Talks with Canada Conclude for the Week with No Agreement | Breitbart   via @BreitbartNews
… Remember, NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made .  The  US  lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs .  We were far better off before NAFTA - should never have been signed .  Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for .  We make new deal or go back to pre-NAFTA !
There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal .  If we don't make a fair deal for the  US  after decades of abuse, Canada will be out .  Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off …

… Donald Trump, and now we find out that there wasn't even a hearing - that Donald Trump's 4th Amendment right to privacy was signed away … and someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true, when it wasn't ?  This is the scandal here - a police state .   Dan Bongino
You have a Fake Dossier, gathered by Steele, paid by the Clinton team to get information on Trump .  The Dossier is Fake, nothing in it has been verified .  It then filters into our American court system in order to spy on Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton's political opponent …
… of the DOJ & FBI are completely out to lunch in terms of exposing and holding those accountable who are responsible for that corruption .  @TomFitton @JudicialWatch
Report :  There were no FISA hearings held over Spy documents . It is astonishing that the FISA courts couldn't hold hearings on Spy Warrants targeting Donald Trump .  It isn't about Carter Page, it's about the Trump Campaign .  You've got corruption at the DOJ & FBI .  The leadership …
I love Canada, but they've taken advantage of our Country for many years !
I think today what has happened is that news reporting has become part of the adversary system .  Alan Dershowitz  It has become tainted and corrupt !  DJT
Still can't believe that Bloomberg violated a firm OFF THE RECORD statement .  Will they put out an apology ?
Great day in North Carolina where Republicans will do very well !
The ABC/Washington Post Poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 Election .  I call it a suppression poll - but by Election Day they brought us, out of shame, to about even .  They will never learn !
@Rasmussen_Poll just came out at 48% approval rate despite the constant and intense Fake News .  Higher than Election Day and higher than President Obama .  Rasmussen was one of the most accurate Election Day polls !

President Donald J .  Trump is Strengthening Retirement Security for American Workers
Wow, I made OFF THE RECORD COMMENTS to Bloomberg concerning Canada, and this powerful understanding was BLATANTLY VIOLATED .  Oh well, just more dishonest reporting .  I am used to it .  At least Canada knows where I stand !
I will be doing a major rally for Senator Ted Cruz in October .  I'm picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find .  As you know, Ted has my complete and total Endorsement .  His opponent is a disaster for Texas - weak on Second Amendment, Crime, Borders, Military, and Vets !
Thank you Indiana, I love you !
Throwback Thursday !  #MAGA
Kevin Stitt ran a great winning campaign against a very tough opponent in Oklahoma .  Kevin is a very successful businessman who will be a fantastic Governor .  He is strong on Crime & Borders, the 2nd Amendment, & loves our Military & Vets .  He has my complete and total Endorsement !
CNN is working frantically to find their source .  Look hard because it doesn't exist .  Whatever was left of CNN's credibility is now gone !
Will be going to Evansville, Indiana, tonight for a big crowd rally with Mike Braun, a very successful businessman who is campaigning to be Indiana's next  US  Senator .  He is strong on Crime & Borders, the 2nd Amendment, and loves our Military & Vets .  Will be a big night !
I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Counsel !  I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions .  So much Fake Reporting and Fake News !
The Rigged Russia Witch Hunt did not come into play, even a little bit, with respect to my decision on Don McGahn !
Wow, Nellie Ohr, Bruce Ohr's wife, is a Russia expert who is fluent in Russian .  She worked for Fusion GPS where she was paid a lot .  Collusion !  Bruce was a boss at the Department of Justice and is, unbelievably, still there !
I am very excited about the person who will be taking the place of Don McGahn as White House Councel !  I liked Don, but he was NOT responsible for me not firing Bob Mueller or Jeff Sessions .  So much Fake Reporting and Fake News !
The only thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was not under investigation !
Ivanka Trump & Jared Kushner had NOTHING to do with the so called pushing out of Don McGahn . The Fake News Media has it, purposely,so wrong !  They love to portray chaos in the White House when they know that chaos doesn't exist-just a smooth running machine with changing parts !
The news from the Financial Markets is even better than anticipated .  For all of you that have made a fortune in the markets, or seen your 401k's rise beyond your wildest expectations, more good news is coming !
I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is .  Truth doesn't matter to them, they only have their hatred & agenda .  This includes fake books, which come out about me all the time, always anonymous sources, and are pure fiction .  Enemy of the People !
What's going on at @CNN is happening, to different degrees, at other networks - with @NBCNews being the worst .  The good news is that Andy Lack(y) is about to be fired( ? ) for incompetence, and much worse .  When Lester Holt got caught fudging my tape on Russia, they were hurt badly !
The hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function .  But actually, as I have always said, this has been going on for a long time .  Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job, his ratings suck, & AT&T should fire him to save credibility !

Ohr told the FBI it (the Fake Dossier) wasn't true, it was a lie and the FBI was determined to use it anyway to damage Trump and to perpetrate a fraud on the court to spy on the Trump campaign .  This is a fraud on the court .  The Chief Justice of the  US  Supreme Court is in …
Lanny Davis admits being anonymous source in CNN Report .  @BretBaier  Oh well, so much for CNN saying it wasn't Lanny .  No wonder their ratings are so low, it's FAKE NEWS !
CNN is being torn apart from within based on their being caught in a major lie and refusing to admit the mistake .  Sloppy @carlbernstein, a man who lives in the past and thinks like a degenerate fool, making up story after story, is being laughed at all over the country !  Fake News

How the hell is Bruce Ohr still employed at the Justice Department ?  Disgraceful !   Witch Hunt !
Consumer Confidence Index, just out, is the HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS !  Also, GDP revised upward to 4 . 2 from 4 . 1 .  Our country is doing great !
White House Counsel Don McGahn will be leaving his position in the fall, shortly after the confirmation (hopefully) of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court .  I have worked with Don for a long time and truly appreciate his service !
Martha McSally is an extraordinary woman .  She was a very talented fighter jet pilot and is now a highly respected member of Congress .  She is Strong on Crime, the Border and our  under siege 2nd Amendment .  Loves our Military and our Vets .  Has my total and complete Endorsement !
When you see anonymous source, stop reading the story, it is fiction !
Anonymous Sources are really starting to BURN the media .  @FoxNews The fact is that many anonymous sources don't even exist .  They are fiction made up by the Fake News reporters .  Look at the lie that Fake CNN is now in .  They got caught red handed !  Enemy of the People !
Big Election Wins last night !  The Republican Party will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !  Actually, it is happening faster than anybody thought possible !  It is morphing into KEEP AMERICA GREAT !
Hillary Clinton and the DNC paid for information from the Russian government to use against her government - there's no doubt about that !  @TuckerCarlson
The Obama people did something that's never been done … They spied on a rival presidential campaign .  Would it be OK if Trump did it next ?  I am losing faith that our system is on the level .  I'm beginning to think it is rotten & corrupt .  Scary stuff Obama did .  @TuckerCarlson  DOJ
Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary, but his opponent in November is his biggest dream … a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime & many other problems to flourish in his city .  This is not what Florida wants or needs !
Martha McSally, running in the Arizona Primary for  US  Senate, was endorsed by rejected Senator Jeff Flake … and turned it down - a first !  Now Martha, a great  US  Military fighter jet pilot and highly respected member of Congress, WINS BIG .  Congratulations, and on to November !
Hillary Clinton's Emails, many of which are Classified Information, got hacked by China .  Next move better be by the FBI & DOJ or, after all of their other missteps (Comey, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr, FISA, Dirty Dossier etc . ), their credibility will be forever gone !
New Poll - A majority of Americans think that John Brennan and James Comey should have their Security Clearances Revoked .  Not surprised !  @FoxNews
Our new Trade Deal with Mexico focuses on FARMERS, GROWTH for our country, tearing down TRADE BARRIERS, JOBS and having companies continue to POUR BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY .  It will be a big hit !
Add the 2026 World Cup to our long list of accomplishments !
Report just out :  China hacked Hillary Clinton's private Email Server .  Are they sure it wasn't Russia (just kidding ! ) ?  What are the odds that the FBI and DOJ are right on top of this ?  Actually, a very big story .  Much classified information !
Congratulations to Governor Rick Scott of Florida on his conclusive Republican Primary Win .  He will be a great Senator !
Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida .  Ron will be a fantastic Governor .  On to November !

Consumer confidence pops in August to highest level since October 2000

A big deal looking good with Mexico !
The Fake News Media worked hard to get Tiger Woods to say something that he didn't want to say .  Tiger wouldn't play the game - he is very smart .  More importantly, he is playing great golf again !

Over 90% approval rating for your all time favorite (I hope) President within the Republican Party and 52% overall .  This despite all of the made up stories by the Fake News Media trying endlessly to make me look as bad and evil as possible .  Look at the real villains please !
Mainstream Media tries to rewrite history to credit Obama for Trump accomplishments .  Since President Trump took office, the economy is booming .  The stronger the economy gets, the more desperate his critics are .  O had weakest recovery since Great Depression .  @WashTimes
Fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday .  Stock Market hits all time high !
… And it will get, as I have always said, much better from even here !
My deepest sympathies and respect go out to the family of Senator John McCain .  Our hearts and prayers are with you !
Stock Market hit all time high on Friday .  Congratulations  USA  !
Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour .  Some really good people within both the new and old government, and all working closely together … A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon !
The FBI looked at less than 1% of Crooked's Emails !
The FBI only looked at 3000 of 675,000 Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails .  They purposely didn't look at the disasters .  This news is just out .  @FoxNews
Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails, many of which are REALLY BAD .  Also gave false election info .  I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption .  At some point I may have to get involved !
@LindseyGrahamSC  Every President deserves an Attorney General they have confidence in .  I believe every President has a right to their Cabinet, these are not lifetime appointments .  You serve at the pleasure of the President .
Jeff Sessions said he wouldn't allow politics to influence him only because he doesn't understand what is happening underneath his command position .  Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched .  No Collusion !
Michaels Cohen's attorney clarified the record, saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting (out of which came nothing ! ) .  The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting .  Just another phony story by the Fake News Media !
Happy birthday Vince, you are truly one of the greats !
Great #StateDinner2018 in Ohio tonight !  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !

… Secretary Pompeo looks forward to going to North Korea in the near future, most likely after our Trading relationship with China is resolved .  In the meantime I would like to send my warmest regards and respect to Chairman Kim .  I look forward to seeing him soon !
… Additionally, because of our much tougher Trading stance with China, I do not believe they are helping with the process of denuclearization as they once were (despite the UN Sanctions which are in place) …
I have asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo not to go to North Korea, at this time, because I feel we are not making sufficient progress with respect to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula …

Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people .  Can't do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN, whose ratings have suffered gravely .  People have to figure out what is real, and what is not, without censorship !
Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over classified information .  Gee, this is small potatoes compared to what Hillary Clinton did !  So unfair Jeff, Double Standard .
… FISA abuse, Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier, the Clinton Foundation, illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign, Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more .  Open up the papers & documents without redaction ?  Come on Jeff, you can do it, the country is waiting !
Department of Justice will not be improperly influenced by political considerations .  Jeff, this is GREAT, what everyone wants, so look into all of the corruption on the other side including deleted Emails, Comey lies & leaks, Mueller conflicts, McCabe, Strzok, Page, Ohr …
Our Economy is setting records on virtually every front - Probably the best our country has ever done .  Tremendous value created since the Election .  The World is respecting us again !  Companies are moving back to the  USA
Target CEO raves about the Economy .  This is the best consumer environment I've seen in my career .  A big statement from a top executive .  But virtually everybody is saying this, & when our Trade Deals are made, & cost cutting done, you haven't seen anything yet !   @DRUDGE_REPORT

The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats .  The problem is, they forgot to campaign in numerous states !
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends by @ainsleyearhardt tomorrow from 6 : 00  AM  to 9 : 00  AM   Enjoy !


Longest bull run in the history of the stock market, congratulations America !


Everyone in the path of #HurricaneLane please prepare yourselves, heed the advice of State and local officials, and follow @NWSHonolulu for updates .  Be safe !
Thank you to Democrat Assemblyman Dov Hikind of New York for your very gracious remarks on @foxandfriends for our deporting a longtime resident Nazi back to Germany !  Others worked on this for decades .
Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime .  President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled !
A large number of counts, ten, could not even be decided in the Paul Manafort case .  Witch Hunt !
I feel very badly for Paul Manafort and his wonderful family .  Justice took a 12 year old tax case, among other things, applied tremendous pressure on him and, unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to break - make up stories in order to get a deal .  Such respect for a brave man !
If anyone is looking for a good lawyer, I would strongly suggest that you don't retain the services of Michael Cohen !
Thank you West Virginia .  I love you !

Bill DeBlasio, the high taxing Mayor of NYC, just stole my campaign slogan :  PROMISES MADE  PROMISES KEPT !  That's not at all nice .  No imagination !  @foxandfriends
Big Rally tonight in West Virginia .  Patrick Morrisey is running a GREAT race for  US  Senate .  I have done so much for West Virginia, against all odds, and having Patrick, a real fighter, by my side, would make things so much easier .  See you later .  CLEAN COAL !  !  !  !
I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY !  If there were no serious consequences, our country would be overrun with people trying to get in, and our system could not handle it !
Fake News, of which there is soooo much (this time the very tired New Yorker) falsely reported that I was going to take the extraordinary step of denying Intelligence Briefings to President Obama .  Never discussed or thought of !
Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails .  Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn't lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress !
A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders .  A Red Wave means Safety and Strength !
I am hearing so many great things about the Republican Party's California Gubernatorial Candidate, John Cox .  He is a very successful businessman who is tired of high Taxes & Crime .  He will Make California Great Again &  make you proud of your Great State again .  Total Endorsement !
Will be going to the Great State of West Virginia on Tuesday Night to campaign & do a Rally Speech for a hard working and spectacular person, A . G .  Patrick Morrisey, who is running for the  US  Senate .  Patrick has great Energy & Stamina-I need his VOTE to MAGA .  Total Endorsement !
Just watched former Intelligence Official Phillip Mudd become totally unglued and weird while debating wonderful @PARISDENNARD over Brennan's Security Clearance .  Dennard destroyed him but Mudd is in no mental condition to have such a Clearance .  Should be REVOKED ?  @seanhannity
@DianeHarkey is an extraordinary woman of great accomplishment & potential .  She is running as a very popular Republican for the Congressional seat of my friend Darrell Issa-with his complete support .  Diane is strong on crime, loves our Military & Vets-has my total Endorsement !

It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the  US  Postal System from China .  We can, and must, END THIS NOW !  The Senate should pass the STOP ACT – and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country .  No more delay !
Bruce Ohr is at the center of FALSE ALLEGATIONS which led to a multi-million dollar investigation into what apparently didn't happen .  Darrell Issa, House Oversight .  We can take out the word apparently .   @FoxNews
Will Bruce Ohr, whose family received big money for helping to create the phony, dirty and discredited Dossier, ever be fired from the Jeff Sessions  Justice Department ?  A total joke !
Everybody wants to keep their Security Clearance, it's worth great prestige and big dollars, even board seats, and that is why certain people are coming forward to protect Brennan .  It certainly isn't because of the good job he did !  He is a political hack .
I hope John Brennan, the worst CIA Director in our country's history, brings a lawsuit .  It will then be very easy to get all of his records, texts, emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did, but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt .  He won't sue !
Where's the Collusion ?  They made up a phony crime called Collusion, and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed) .  If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt, they scream Obstruction !
… looking for trouble .  They are enjoying ruining people's lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies, the firings, the deleted Emails and soooo much more !  Mueller's Angry Dems are looking to impact the election .  They are a National Disgrace !
Disgraced and discredited Bob Mueller and his whole group of Angry Democrat Thugs spent over 30 hours with the White House Councel, only with my approval, for purposes of transparency .  Anybody needing that much time when they know there is no Russian Collusion is just someone …
Study the late Joseph McCarthy, because we are now in period with Mueller and his gang that make Joseph McCarthy look like a baby !  Rigged Witch Hunt !
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times .  They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward .  From the day I announced, the Times has been Fake News, and with their disgusting new Board Member, it will only get worse !
The Failing New York Times wrote a story that made it seem like the White House Councel had TURNED on the President, when in fact it is just the opposite - & the two Fake reporters knew this .  This is why the Fake News Media has become the Enemy of the People .  So bad for America !
No Collusion and No Obstruction, except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats .  All of the resignations and corruption, yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction .  What about the Brennan, Comey, McCabe, Strzok lies to Congress, or Crooked's Emails !
… and have demanded transparency so that this Rigged and Disgusting Witch Hunt can come to a close .  So many lives have been ruined over nothing - McCarthyism at its WORST !  Yet Mueller & his gang of Dems refuse to look at the real crimes on the other side - Media is even worse !
The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel, he must be a John Dean type RAT .  But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn't have to .  I have nothing to hide …
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn, and all other requested members of the White House Staff, to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel .  In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents .  Most transparent in history .  No Collusion, No Obstruction .  Witch Hunt !

The United States has ended the ridiculous 230 Million Dollar yearly development payment to Syria .  Saudi Arabia and other rich countries in the Middle East will start making payments instead of the  US  I want to develop the  US , our military and countries that help us !

The Economy is stronger and better than ever before .  Importantly, there remains tremendous potential - it will only get better with time !
Great Job  Rachel Campos-Duffy on @foxandfriends .
Has anyone looked at the mistakes that John Brennan made while serving as CIA Director ?  He will go down as easily the WORST in history & since getting out, he has become nothing less than a loudmouth, partisan, political hack who cannot be trusted with the secrets to our country !

All of the fools that are so focused on looking only at Russia should start also looking in another direction, China .  But in the end, if we are smart, tough and well prepared, we will get along with everyone !
… Too many voices are being destroyed, some good & some bad, and that cannot be allowed to happen .  Who is making the choices, because I can already tell you that too many mistakes are being made .  Let everybody participate, good & bad, and we will all just have to figure it out !
… Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police .  If you are weeding out Fake News, there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC, & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed .  I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt, or don't watch at all .  .
Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices .  Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration, we won't let that happen .  They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT, while at the same time doing nothing to others …
… financial gain is a Federal Gratuity Statute Violation, Bribery Statute Violation, Honest Services Violation … all Major Crimes … because the DOJ is run by BLANK Jeff Sessions …   Gregg Jarrett .   So when does Mueller do what must be done ?  Probably never !  @FoxNews
Bruce Ohr of DOJ is in legal jeopardy, it's astonishing that he's still employed .  Bruce & Nelly Ohr's bank account is getting fatter & fatter because of the Dossier that they are both peddling .  He doesn't disclose it under Fed Regs .  Using your Federal office for personal …

Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed .   Charles Payne  @FoxBusiness   How much more does Mueller have to see ?  They have blinders on - RIGGED !

… I say Andrew's was a bigger and more incompetent blunder .  He should easily win his race against a Super Liberal Actress, but his political career is over !
Which is worse, Hightax Andrew Cuomo's statement, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT or Hillary Clinton's DEPLORABLES statement …
When a politician admits that We're not going to make America great again, there doesn't seem to be much reason to ever vote for him .  This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo, with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris !
Wow !  Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America's lack of greatness .  I have already MADE America Great Again, just look at the markets, jobs, military- setting records, and we will do even better .  Andrew choked badly, mistake !

The  US  has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago .
Just announced, youth unemployment is at a 50 year low !   @foxandfriends
… attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date, & go to the Paris parade, celebrating the end of the War, on November 11th .  Maybe we will do something next year in  DC  when the cost comes WAY DOWN .  Now we can buy some more jet fighters !
The local politicians who run Washington,  DC  (poorly) know a windfall when they see it .  When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade, they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it .  Never let someone hold you up !  I will instead …
How does a politician, Cuomo, known for pushing people and businesses out of his state, not to mention having the highest taxes in the  US , survive making the statement, WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT ?  Which section of the sentence is worse ?
In speaking with some of the world's top business leaders I asked what it is that would make business (jobs) even better in the  US  Stop quarterly reporting & go to a six month system, said one .  That would allow greater flexibility & save money .  I have asked the SEC to study !
… released in 2017 .  If his statement is based on intelligence he has seen since leaving office, it constitutes an intelligence breach …   Richard Burr (R-NC) Senate Intel Cmte Chair  @LouDobbs
Director Brennan's recent statements purport to know as fact that the Trump campaign colluded with a foreign power .  If Director Brennan's statement is based on intelligence he received while leading the CIA, why didn't he include it in the Intelligence Community Assessment …
… An incredibly corrupt FBI & DOJ trying to steer the outcome of a Presidential Election .  Brennan has gone off the deep end, he's disgraced and discredited himself .  His conduct has been outrageous .  Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch .
How can Senator Richard Blumenthal, who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam), pass judgement on anyone ?  Loser !
@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan :  How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place ?  Now that is a really good question !  Then followed by Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero …  So true, a total Fake !
Very concerned about Comey's firing, afraid they will be exposed, said Bruce Ohr .  DOJ's Emails & Notes show Bruce Ohr's connection to (phony & discredited) Trump Dossier .  A creep thinking he would get caught in a dishonest act .  Rigged Witch Hunt !
While Steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets, he also asked for help with a RUSSIAN Oligarch .   Catherine Herridge of @FoxNews  @LouDobbs  In other words, they were colluding with Russia !
The FBI received documents from Bruce Ohr (of the Justice Department & whose wife Nelly worked for Fusion GPS) .  Disgraced and fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok .  This is too crazy to be believed !  The Rigged Witch Hunt has zero credibility .
Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years .  They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor, who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage .  We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man, but we are cutting back on Turkey !
Thank you for the kind words Omarosa !
Great @Cabinet meeting today at the @WhiteHouse !
The Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, is dead .  She was a great woman, with a wonderful gift from God, her voice .  She will be missed !
There is nothing that I would want more for our Country than true FREEDOM OF THE PRESS .  The fact is that the Press is FREE to write and say anything it wants, but much of what it says is FAKE NEWS, pushing a political agenda or just plain trying to hurt people .  HONESTY WINS !
The Boston Globe, which was sold to the the Failing New York Times for 1 . 3 BILLION DOLLARS (plus 800 million dollars in losses & investment), or 2 . 1 BILLION DOLLARS, was then sold by the Times for 1 DOLLAR .  Now the Globe is in COLLUSION with other papers on free press .  PROVE IT !
THE FAKE NEWS MEDIA IS THE OPPOSITION PARTY .  It is very bad for our Great Country … BUT WE ARE WINNING !
Our Economy is doing better than ever .  Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before, companies earnings are higher than ever, inflation is low & business optimism is higher than it has ever been .  For the first time in many decades, we are protecting our workers !
I'd strip the whole bunch of them .  They're all corrupt .  They've all abused their power .  They've all betrayed the American people with a political agenda .  They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States .  @seanhannity
Mark Levin When they had power they didn't stop the Russians, the Chinese, the North Koreans, they funded the Iranians & are responsible for the greatest scandal in American history by interfering with our election & trying to undermine the Trump Campaign and Trump Presidency .
WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT .  Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the  US , Andrew Cuomo, having a total meltdown !
WE'RE NOT GONG TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT .   Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the  US , Andrew Cuomo, having a total meltdown !
Hillary Clinton clearly got a pass by the FBI .  We have the unfortunate situation where they then decided they were going to frame Donald Trump concerning the Rigged Witch Hunt .  JOE DIGENOVA, former  US  Attorney .
John Brennan is a stain on the Country, we deserve better than this .  Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book, Spygate, the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J .  Trump, Dan Bongino .  Thank you Dan, and good luck with the book !
Chuck Schumer, I agree !
Our Country was built on Tariffs, and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President .  Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great  USA  No longer !
Happy Birthday to the leader of the Democrat Party, Maxine Waters !
The action (the Strzok firing) was a decisive step in the right direction in correcting the wrongs committed by what has been described as Comey's skinny inner circle .   Chris Swecker, former FBI Assistant Director .
The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the originators and founders of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity .  All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax, and much more will be lost as it proceeds .  No Collusion !
My friend and very early supporter Kris Kobach won the Republican Nomination for Governor of Kansas last night in a tough race against a very fine opponent .  Kris will win in November and be a great Governor .  He has my complete and total Endorsement !
It is about time that Connecticut had a real and talented Governor .  Bob Stefanowski is the person needed to do the job .  Tough on crime, Bob is also a big cutter of Taxes .  He will win in November and make a Great Governor, a major difference maker .  Bob has my total Endorsement !
@PeteStauber won big last night in Minnesota .  A big star in Hockey, he will be an even bigger star in politics .  It all begins with a win in November .  Pete has my complete and total Endorsement !
People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the  US  legally .  Chuck Schumer in 2009, before he went left and haywire !   @foxandfriends
Congratulations to Bryan Steil on a wonderful win last night .  You will be replacing a great guy in Paul Ryan, and your win in November will make the entire State of Wisconsin very proud .  You have my complete and total Endorsement !
Jeff Johnson of Minnesota had a big night in winning the Republican nomination for Governor against a very strong and well known opponent !  Thanks for all of the support you showed me .  You have my complete and total Endorsement .  You will win in November !
Scott Walker is very special and will have another great win in November .  He has done a fantastic job as Governor of Wisconsin and will always have my full support and Endorsement !
Congratulations to Bryan Steil on a wonderful win last night .  Your will be replacing a great guy in Paul Ryan, and your win in November will make the entire State of Wisconsin very proud .  You have my complete and total Endorsement !
Congratulations to Leah Vukmir of Wisconsin on your great win last night .  You beat a very tough and good competitor and will make a fantastic Senator after winning in November against someone who has done very little .  You have my complete and total Endorsement !

Great Republican election results last night .  So far we have the team we want .  8 for 9 in Special Elections .  Red Wave !

Lou Dobbs :  This cannot go forward … this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia .  The Dems are the ones who should be investigated .  Thank you Lou, so true !
Strzok started the illegal Rigged Witch Hunt - why isn't this so-called probe ended immediately ?  Why aren't these angry and conflicted Democrats instead looking at Crooked Hillary ?
Fired FBI Agent Peter Strzok is a fraud, as is the rigged investigation he started .  There was no Collusion or Obstruction with Russia, and everybody, including the Democrats, know it .  The only Collusion and Obstruction was by Crooked Hillary, the Democrats and the DNC !
They were all in on it, clear Hillary Clinton and FRAME Donald Trump for things he didn't do .  Gregg Jarrett on @foxandfriends  If we had a real Attorney General, this Witch Hunt would never have been started !  Looking at the wrong people .
Bruce Ohr of the Justice Department (can you believe he is still there) is accused of helping disgraced Christopher Steele find dirt on Trump .  Ohr's wife, Nelly, was in on the act big time - worked for Fusion GPS on Fake Dossier .  @foxandfriends
Another terrorist attack in London … These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength !
When you give a crazed, crying lowlife a break, and give her a job at the White House, I guess it just didn't work out .  Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog !
Lou Dobbs :  This cannot go forward … this Special Councel with all of his conflicts, with his 17 Angry Democrats, without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia .  The Dems are the ones who should be investigated .  Thank you Lou, so true !
… should be shut down .  The Strzok firing shows that the fundamental underpinnings of the investigation were corrupt .  It should be shut down by the courts or by honest prosecutors .  Thank you Judicial Watch, I couldn't have said it better myself !
… guy was corrupt and had anti-Trump animus .  Strzok and others at the FBI should be criminally investigated for the way the conducted this investigation .  Instead, Mueller is pretending nothing went wrong .  He used Strzok, he used the Clinton DNC Dossier … the whole thing …
Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch :  The Strzok firing is as much about the Mueller operation as anything else .  There would be no Mueller Special Councel to investigate so called collusion but for the machinations of Strzok & his colleagues at the top levels of the FBI .  We know this …
… such wonderful and powerful things about me - a true Champion of Civil Rights - until she got fired .  Omarosa had Zero credibility with the Media (they didn't want interviews) when she worked in the White House .  Now that she says bad about me, they will talk to her .  Fake News !
@MarkBurnettTV called to say that there are NO TAPES of the Apprentice where I used such a terrible and disgusting word as attributed by Wacky and Deranged Omarosa .  I don't have that word in my vocabulary, and never have .  She made it up .  Look at her MANY recent quotes saying …

Scott Walker of Wisconsin is a tremendous Governor who has done incredible things for that Great State .  He has my complete & total Endorsement !  He brought the amazing Foxconn to Wisconsin with its 15,000 Jobs-and so much more .  Vote for Scott on Tuesday in the Republican Primary !
Trump's foreign policy is actually boosting America's standing
It was my great honor to sign our new Defense Bill into law and to pay tribute to the greatest soldiers in the history of the world :  THE  US  ARMY .  The National Defense Authorization Act is the most significant investment in our Military and our warfighters in modern history !
Pete Stauber is running for Congress in Minnesota .  He will make for a great Congressman .  Pete is strong on crime and borders, loves our Military, Vets and Second Amendment .  Vote for Pete tomorrow .  He has my full and total Endorsement !
Great to be in Fort Drum, New York with our HEROES !
Just landed at Fort Drum, New York .  Looking forward to making a speech about our GREAT HEROES !
Brooks Koepka just won his third Golf Major, and he did it not only with his powerful game, but with his powerful mind .  He has been a man of steel on the Tour and will have many Victories, including Majors, ahead of him .  Congrats to Brooks and his great team on a job well done !
Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement !
Just fired Agent Strzok, formerly of the FBI, was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation .  It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone !
Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally .  The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer .  Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt, will it be dropped ?  It is a total Hoax .  No Collusion, No Obstruction - I just fight back !
The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson's recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate .  Even Kasich's Lt .  Governor lost Gov .  race because of his unpopularity .  Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN !
While I know it's not presidential to take on a lowlife like Omarosa, and while I would rather not be doing so, this is a modern day form of communication and I know the Fake News Media will be working overtime to make even Wacky Omarosa look legitimate as possible .  Sorry !
… really bad things .  Nasty to people & would constantly miss meetings & work .  When Gen .  Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems .  I told him to try working it out, if possible, because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired !
Wacky Omarosa, who got fired 3 times on the Apprentice, now got fired for the last time .  She never made it, never will .  She begged me for a job, tears in her eyes, I said Ok .  People in the White House hated her .  She was vicious, but not smart .  I would rarely see her but heard …
Seems like the Department of Justice (and FBI) had a program to keep Donald Trump from becoming President .  @DarrellIssa  @foxandfriends  If this had happened to the other side, everybody involved would be in jail .  This is a Media coverup of the biggest story of our time .
Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas .  Great !  Most other companies are coming in our direction, including Harley competitors .  A really bad move !   US  will soon have a level playing field, or better .
@GovMikeHuckabee Your paycheck is bigger, your pension is stronger .  @foxandfriends  Unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years, & perhaps ever .  Our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better !  Many companies moving back to the  USA
@JudgeJeanine  Bob Mueller, isn't your whole investigation premised on a Fake Dossier, paid for by Hillary, created by a man who hates Donald Trump, & used to con a FISA Court Judge .  Bob, I really think it's time for you to give up your phony investigation .  No Collusion !
Bikers for Trump at Bedminster earlier today .  Thank you !
Hundreds of Bikers for Trump just joined me at Bedminster .  Quite a scene - great people who truly love our Country !
… Do you believe Nelly worked for Fusion and her husband STILL WORKS FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE .  I have never seen anything so Rigged in my life .  Our A . G .  is scared stiff and Missing in Action .  It is all starting to be revealed - not pretty .  IG Report soon ?   Witch Hunt !
The big story that the Fake News Media refuses to report is lowlife Christopher Steele's many meetings with Deputy A . G .  Bruce Ohr and his beautiful wife, Nelly .  It was Fusion GPS that hired Steele to write the phony & discredited Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary & the DNC …
I am proud to have fought for and secured the LOWEST African American and Hispanic unemployment rates in history .  Now I'm pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance .  I will never stop fighting for ALL Americans !
The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division .  We must come together as a nation .  I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence .  Peace to ALL Americans !
… Will the FBI ever recover it's once stellar reputation, so badly damaged by Comey, McCabe, Peter S and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, and other top officials now dismissed or fired ?  So many of the great men and women of the FBI have been hurt by these clowns and losers !
Why isn't the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages  to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities .  FBI said they won't give up even one (I may have to get involved, DO NOT DESTROY) .  What are they hiding ?  McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people …

Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely .  Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal .  New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman .  Canada must wait .  Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high .  Will tax cars if we can't make a deal !
Thank you to Kanye West and the fact that he is willing to tell the TRUTH .  One new and great FACT - African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in the history of our Country .  So honored by this .  Thank you Kanye for your support .  It is making a big difference !
Had a very good phone call with @EmmanuelMacron, President of France .  Discussed various subjects, in particular Security and Trade .  Many other calls and conversations today .  Looking forward to dinner tonight with Tim Cook of Apple .  He is investing big dollars in  USA
Democrats, please do not distance yourselves from Nancy Pelosi .  She is a wonderful person whose ideas & policies may be bad, but who should definitely be given a 4th chance .  She is trying very hard & has every right to take down the Democrat Party if she has veered too far left !
I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency, the Turkish Lira, slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar !  Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50% .  Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time !
… Be happy, be cool !  A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest .  Most of that money goes to the players anyway .  Find another way to protest .  Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay !
The NFL players are at it again - taking a knee when they should be standing proudly for the National Anthem .  Numerous players, from different teams, wanted to show their outrage at something that most of them are unable to define .  They make a fortune doing what they love …
@MariaBartiromo  No evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between Donald Trump and the Russians - and here we are, a year and a half later .
Jenna Ellis  FBI thought they wouldn't get caught because they thought that Hillary was going to win .  There is overt bias and that depends on whether you are Democrat or Republican - a double standard that needs to stop .
@LindseyGrahamSC  Why didn't the FBI tell President Trump that they had concerns about Carter Page ?  Is there a double standard here ?  They told Senator Diane Feinstein that she had a spy - but not Trump .  Is that entrapment or did they just want to use Page as an excuse to SPY ?
Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total Endorsement !  Tough on Crime and Borders, Ted was really helpful on Tax Cuts .  Vote all the way for Ted in the upcoming Primary - he will never let you down !
Space Force all the way !
This is an illegally brought Rigged Witch Hunt run by people who are totally corrupt and/or conflicted .  It was started and paid for by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats .  Phony Dossier, FISA disgrace and so many lying and dishonest people already fired .  17 Angry Dems ?  Stay tuned !
There has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election .  In fact the evidence is the opposite, that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election .  @GrahamLedger
RED WAVE !
Congratulations to @LenaEpstein of Michigan on a job well done .  Also, thanks for your great support !
As long as I campaign and/or support Senate and House candidates (within reason), they will win !  I LOVE the people, & they certainly seem to like the job I'm doing .  If I find the time, in between China, Iran, the Economy and much more, which I must, we will have a giant Red Wave !
The Republicans have now won 8 out of 9 House Seats, yet if you listen to the Fake News Media you would think we are being clobbered .  Why can't they play it straight, so unfair to the Republican Party and in particular, your favorite President !
5 for 5 !
Congratulations to Josh Hawley on your big Senate Primary win in Missouri .  I look forward to working with you toward a big win in November .  We need you in Washington !
Congratulations to Bill Schuette .  You will have a Big win in November and be a tremendous Governor for the Great State of Michigan .  Lots of car and other companies moving back !
Congratulations to a future STAR of the Republican Party, future Senator John James .  A big and bold victory tonight in the Great State of Michigan - the first of many .  November can't come fast enough !
… Congratulations to Troy Balderson on a great win in Ohio .  A very special and important race !
When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson, he was down in early voting 64 to 36 .  That was not good .  After my speech on Saturday night, there was a big turn for the better .  Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting .  He will win BIG in Nov .
Today, on the 236th anniversary of the Purple Heart, we honor the members of our Armed Forces for serving as the vanguard of American democracy and freedom around the world .  #PurpleHeartDay
Ohio, vote today for Troy Balderson for Congress .  His opponent, controlled by Nancy Pelosi, is weak on Crime, the Border, Military, Vets, your 2nd Amendment - and will end your Tax Cuts .  Troy will be a great Congressman .  #MAGA
The Iran sanctions have officially been cast .  These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed, and in November they ratchet up to yet another level .  Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States .  I am asking for WORLD PEACE, nothing less !
California wildfires are being magnified & made so much worse by the bad environmental laws which aren't allowing massive amounts of readily available water to be properly utilized .  It is being diverted into the Pacific Ocean .  Must also tree clear to stop fire from spreading !
Democrats want Open Borders and they want to abolish ICE, the brave men and women that are protecting our Country from some of the most vicious and dangerous people on earth !  Sorry, we can't let that happen !  Also, change the rules in the Senate and approve STRONG Border Security !

Governor Jerry Brown must allow the Free Flow of the vast amounts of water coming from the North and foolishly being diverted into the Pacific Ocean .  Can be used for fires, farming and everything else .  Think of California with plenty of Water - Nice !  Fast Federal govt .  approvals .
Kris Kobach, a strong and early supporter of mine, is running for Governor of the Great State of Kansas .   He is a fantastic guy who loves his State and our Country - he will be a GREAT Governor and has my full & total Endorsement !  Strong on Crime, Border & Military .  VOTE TUESDAY !
Great financial numbers being announced on an almost daily basis .  Economy has never been better, jobs at best point in history .  Fixing our terrible Trade Deals is a priority-and going very well .  Immigration on Merit Based System to take care of the companies coming back to  USA
… a law firm, eventually Kremlin connected sources, to gather info on Donald Trump .  Collusion is very real with Russia, but only with Hillary and the Democrats, and we should demand a full investigation .  Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends  Looking forward to the new IG Report !
Collusion with Russia was very real .  Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians, and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT .  We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through …

Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy, military and just about everything else .  Better numbers than Obama at this point, by far .  We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave, but there might be a Red Wave !
Too bad a large portion of the Media refuses to report the lies and corruption having to do with the Rigged Witch Hunt - but that is why we call them FAKE NEWS !
… Why aren't Mueller and the 17 Angry Democrats looking at the meetings concerning the Fake Dossier and all of the lying that went on in the FBI and DOJ ?  This is the most one sided Witch Hunt in the history of our country .  Fortunately, the facts are all coming out, and fast !
Fake News reporting, a complete fabrication, that I am concerned about the meeting my wonderful son, Donald, had in Trump Tower .  This was a meeting to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics - and it went nowhere .  I did not know about it !
.  . Because of Tariffs we will be able to start paying down large amounts of the $21 Trillion in debt that has been accumulated, much by the Obama Administration, while at the same time reducing taxes for our people .  At minimum, we will make much better Trade Deals for our country !
Tariffs are working big time .  Every country on earth wants to take wealth out of the  US , always to our detriment .  I say, as they come,Tax them .  If they don't want to be taxed, let them make or build the product in the  US  In either event, it means jobs and great wealth …
The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it's TRUE .  I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People .  They purposely cause great division & distrust .  They can also cause War !  They are very dangerous & sick !
… Danny O'Connor is a total puppet for Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters – Danny wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, and take away your 2nd Amendment .  Vote for Troy on Tuesday !
A great night in Ohio's 12th Congressional District with Troy Balderson !  Troy loves Ohio, and he loves the people of Ohio .  He will be fighting for you all the way …
Thank you Ohio .  I love you !
Iran, and it's economy, is going very bad, and fast !  I will meet, or not meet, it doesn't matter - it is up to them !
Heading to Ohio !
… China, which is for the first time doing poorly against us, is spending a fortune on ads and P . R .  trying to convince and scare our politicians to fight me on Tariffs- because they are really hurting their economy .  Likewise other countries .  We are Winning, but must be strong !
… Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today .  Only fools would disagree .  We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and, if countries are still unwilling to negotiate, they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs .  We win either way …
… Tariffs have had a tremendous positive impact on our Steel Industry .  Plants are opening all over the  US , Steelworkers are working again, and big dollars are flowing into our Treasury .  Other countries use Tariffs against, but when we use them, foolish people scream !
Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated .  China market has dropped 27% in last 4months, and they are talking to us .  Our market is stronger than ever, and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated .  America First …
HAPPY BIRTHDAY @USCG !
Troy Balderson, running for Congress from Ohio, is in a big Election fight with a candidate who just got caught lying about his relationship with Nancy Pelosi, who is weak on Crime, Borders & your 2nd Amendment-and wants to raise your Taxes (by a lot) .  Vote for Troy on Tuesday !
Will be going to Ohio tonight to campaign for Troy Balderson for the big Congressional Special Election on Tuesday .  Early voting is on .  Troy is strong on Crime, the Border & loves our Military, Vets & 2nd Amendment .  His opponent is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi/high taxes .
Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon .  He made Lebron look smart, which isn't easy to do .  I like Mike !
… Dianne is the person leading our Nation on Collusion with Russia (only done by Dems) .  Will she now investigate herself ?
Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett on his book, THE RUSSIA HOAX, THE ILLICIT SCHEME TO CLEAR HILLARY CLINTON AND FRAME DONALD TRUMP, going to #1 on @nytimes and Amazon .  It is indeed a HOAX and WITCH HUNT, illegally started by people who have already been disgraced .  Great book !
Great photo from Ocean City, Maryland .  Thank you .  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Almost 500,000 Manufacturing Jobs created since I won the Election .  Remember when my opponents were saying that we couldn't create this type of job anymore .  Wrong, in fact these are among our best and most important jobs !
The media are good news fire extinguishers !  @greggutfeld @TheFive
NASA, which is making a BIG comeback under the Trump Administration, has just named 9 astronauts for Boeing and Spacex space flights .  We have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them .  Exciting things happening .  Space Force !
July is just the ninth month since 1970 that unemployment has fallen below 4% .  Our economy has added 3 . 7 million jobs since I won the Election .  4 . 1 GDP .  More than 4 million people have received a pay raise due to tax reform .  $400 Billion brought back from overseas .  @FoxNews
Marsha Blackburn had a BIG win last night in the Tennessee primary for  US  Senate .  She is an outstanding person & great supporter of mine .  Congratulations Marsha, we need you very badly in the Senate to vote for our agenda .  Your next opponent will vote against all we are doing !
Pastor praises Trump as 'pro-black' at prison reform event
Congratulations Marsha !
Congratulations to Bill Lee of Tennessee on his big primary win for Governor last night .   He ran a great campaign and now will finish off the job in November .  Bill has my total and enthusiastic Endorsement !
Thank you Pennsylvania .  I love you !
They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people .  She correctly said no .  It is the FAKE NEWS, which is a large percentage of the media, that is the enemy of the people !
Looking forward to being in the Great State of Ohio on Saturday night where I will be campaigning hard for a truly talented future Congressman, @Troy_Balderson .  See you all then !  Tickets :
When the House and Senate meet on the very important Farm Bill – we love our farmers - hopefully they will be able to leave the WORK REQUIREMENTS FOR FOOD STAMPS PROVISION that the House approved .  Senate should go to 51 votes !
Pennsylvania has to love Trump because unlike all of the others before me, I am bringing STEEL BACK in a VERY BIG way .  Plants opening up in Pennsylvania, and all over the Country, and Congressman Lou Barletta, who is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania, is really helping !
Looking forward to being in the Great State of Pennsylvania where we had a tremendous victory in the Election .  Will be campaigning hard for an original supporter, Lou Barletta, to replace a weak an ineffective Senator, Bob Casey .  Lou is tough and smart, loves PA and our Country !
Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio has done a fantastic job as Chairman of the @NRCC .  He is a great Congressman who is tough on crime & borders & an inspiration to our Military & Vets .  Big on 2nd Amendment .  Get out and vote for Steve on Aug 7th .  He has my full & total endorsement !
Working hard, thank you !
Wow, @foxandfriends is blowing away the competition in the morning ratings .  Morning Joe is a dead show with very few people watching and sadly, Fake News CNN is also doing poorly .  Too much hate and inaccurately reported stories - too predictable !
Charles Koch of Koch Brothers, who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this ( ? ), now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to foreign workers .  He is correct, AMERICA FIRST !
Thank you to Chairman Kim Jong Un for keeping your word & starting the process of sending home the remains of our great and beloved missing fallen !  I am not at all surprised that you took this kind action .  Also, thank you for your nice letter - l look forward to seeing you soon !
Congratulations to  @GreggJarrett on The TREMENDOUS success of his just out book, The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump .  Already number one on Amazon .  Hard work from a brilliant guy .  It's the Real Story of the Rigged Witch Hunt !
Incredibly beautiful ceremony as  US  Korean War remains are returned to American soil .  Thank you to Honolulu and all of our great Military participants on a job well done .  A special thanks to Vice President Mike Pence on delivering a truly magnificent tribute !

It was my great honor to be joined by leading pastors and faith leaders from across our Nation today at the @WhiteHouse !
We already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent, it was Hillary Clinton .  How is it OK for Hillary Clinton to proactively seek dirt from the Russians but the Trump campaign met at the Russians request and that is bad ?  Marc Thiessen, Washington Post
Looking back on history, who was treated worse, Alfonse Capone, legendary mob boss, killer and Public Enemy Number One, or Paul Manafort, political operative & Reagan/Dole darling, now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing ?  Where is the Russian Collusion ?

Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign, one of the most successful in history, is a TOTAL HOAX .  The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was, along with Comey, McCabe, Strzok and his lover, the lovely Lisa Page, used to begin the Witch Hunt .  Disgraceful !
Paul Manafort worked for Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other highly prominent and respected political leaders .  He worked for me for a very short time .  Why didn't government tell me that he was under investigation .  These old charges have nothing to do with Collusion - a Hoax !
.  . This is a terrible situation and Attorney General Jeff Sessions should stop this Rigged Witch Hunt right now, before it continues to stain our country any further .  Bob Mueller is totally conflicted, and his 17 Angry Democrats that are doing his dirty work are a disgrace to USA !
… remain in the FBI while he himself was being investigated .  This is a real issue .  It won't go into a Mueller Report because Mueller is going to protect these guys .  Mueller has an interest in creating the illusion of objectivity around his investigation .  ALAN DERSHOWITZ …
FBI Agent Peter Strzok (on the Mueller team) should have recused himself on day one .  He was out to STOP THE ELECTION OF DONALD TRUMP .  He needed an insurance policy .  Those are illegal, improper goals, trying to influence the Election .  He should never, ever been allowed to …
Thank you Florida .  I love you !
On my way to Tampa, Florida .  Look forward to seeing everyone soon !
Worker pay rate hits highest level since 2008
… Border Security is National Security, and National Security is the long-term viability of our Country .  A Government Shutdown is a very small price to pay for a safe and Prosperous America !
I don't care what the political ramifications are, our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades, and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown …
@SenJohnBarrasso has a Primary on August 21st .  He doesn't need any help because he is absolutely outstanding in every way, but I hope the great people of Wyoming will go out and show their support anyway .  John is absolutely top of the line & has my Complete & Total Endorsement !
Congressman David Kustoff has been a champion for the Trump Agenda - I greatly appreciate his support .  David is strong on crime and borders, loves our Military, Vets and Second Amendment .  Get out and vote for David on Thursday, August 2nd .  He has my Full and Total Endorsement !
The Fake News Media is going CRAZY !  They are totally unhinged and in many ways, after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people, I enjoy watching .  In 7 years, when I am no longer in office, their ratings will dry up and they will be gone !
Will be in Tampa tonight .  A big year for @RepDeSantis, who will be a great governor for Florida .  Strong on Crime, Borders and our 2nd Amendment .  Big help on Tax & Regulation Cuts .  Loves our Military & our Vets .  Has my Full & Total Endorsement !
I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public .  Already spoke to NRA, doesn't seem to make much sense !
Collusion is not a crime, but that doesn't matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats) !
One of the reasons we need Great Border Security is that Mexico's murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31,174 people killed, a record !  The Democrats want Open Borders .  I want Maximum Border Security and respect for ICE and our great Law Enforcement Professionals !  @FoxNews
Rush Limbaugh is a great guy who truly gets it !
… them richer .  Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn .  They want to protect their companies outside the  US  from being taxed, I'm for America First & the American Worker - a puppet for no one .  Two nice guys with bad ideas .  Make America Great Again !
The globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade .  I never sought their support because I don't need their money or bad ideas .  They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more .  I made …
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
A highly respected Federal judge today stated that the Trump Administration gets great credit for reuniting illegal families .  Thank you, and please look at the previous administrations record - not good !
Congratulations to our new @DeptVetAffairs Secretary, Robert Wilkie !
Thank you to @RandPaul for your YES on a future great Justice of the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh .  Your vote means a lot to me, and to everyone who loves our Country !
… that Open Borders, large scale Crime, and abolishing ICE is good for them, we must get smart and finally do what must be done for the Safety and Security of our Country !
Illegal immigration is a top National Security problem .  After decades of playing games, with the whole World laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws, and with Democrats thinking …
Congratulations to Judge Jeanine on the tremendous success of her new #1 best-selling book, Liars, Leakers, and Liberals – The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy !

Congratulations to General John Kelly .  Today we celebrate his first full year as @WhiteHouse Chief of Staff !
🇺🇸🇮🇹
It is my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @GiuseppeConteIT of Italy to the @WhiteHouse !  Join us at 2 : 00pmE for our joint press conference :
We must have Border Security, get rid of Chain, Lottery, Catch & Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration .  Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and, of course, keep building, but much faster, THE WALL !
… Also, why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems, some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary, others, including himself, have worked for Obama … And why isn't Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta, Dossier ?
Is Robert Mueller ever going to release his conflicts of interest with respect to President Trump, including the fact that we had a very nasty & contentious business relationship, I turned him down to head the FBI (one day before appointment as S . C . ) & Comey is his close friend .  .
There is No Collusion !  The Robert Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt, headed now by 17 (increased from 13, including an Obama White House lawyer) Angry Democrats, was started by a fraudulent Dossier, paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC .  Therefore, the Witch Hunt is an illegal Scam !
… and the Amazon Washington Post do nothing but write bad stories even on very positive achievements - and they will never change !
… dying newspaper industry .  No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up, our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people !  As an example, the failing New York Times …
… accurately .  90% of media coverage of my Administration is negative, despite the tremendously positive results we are achieving, it's no surprise that confidence in the media is at an all time low !  I will not allow our great country to be sold out by anti-Trump haters in the …
When the media - driven insane by their Trump Derangement Syndrome - reveals internal deliberations of our government, it  truly puts the lives of many, not just journalists, at risk !  Very unpatriotic !  Freedom of the press also comes with a responsibility to report the news …
I would be willing to shut down government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security, which includes the Wall !  Must get rid of Lottery, Catch & Release etc .  and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT !  We need great people coming into our Country !
The biggest and best results coming out of the good GDP report was that the quarterly Trade Deficit has been reduced by $52 Billion and, of course, the historically low unemployment numbers, especially for African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and Women .
Had a very good and interesting meeting at the White House with A . G .  Sulzberger, Publisher of the New York Times .  Spent much time talking about the vast amounts of Fake News being put out by the media & how that Fake News has morphed into phrase, Enemy of the People .  Sad !
Please understand, there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally, whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes .  Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST & WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world !  Vote R
Do you think the Fake News Media will ever report on this tweet from Michael ?
Wow, highest Poll Numbers in the history of the Republican Party .  That includes Honest Abe Lincoln and Ronald Reagan .  There must be something wrong, please recheck that poll !
Tom Homan, fmr ICE Director :  There is nobody that has done more for border security & public safety than President Trump .  I've worked for six presidents, and I respect them all, but nobody has done more than this Administration & President Trump, that's just a stone cold fact !

Join me in Tampa, Florida next Tuesday, July 31st at 7 : 00pmE for a #MAGA Rally !  Tickets :
The only things the Democrats do well is Resist, which is their campaign slogan, and Obstruct .  Cryin' Chuck Schumer has almost 400 great American people that are waiting forever to serve our Country !  A total disgrace .  Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved !
Democrats, who want Open Borders and care little about Crime, are incompetent, but they have the Fake News Media almost totally on their side !
Congressman David Kustoff has been a champion for the Trump Agenda - I greatly appreciate his support .  David is strong on crime and borders, loves our Military, Vets and Second Amendment .  Get out and vote for David on Thursday, August 2nd .  He has my full and total Endorsement !
Private business investment has surged from 1 . 8 percent the year BEFORE I came into office to 9 . 4 percent this year -- that means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !
The @USNavy's first female Admiral, Alene Duerk once said :  It was a nice distinction to have, and to be recognized as the first, but I wanted to make certain that I used that notoriety to do as much positive as I could .  Alene did just that, and America is forever grateful !
We have accomplished an economic turnaround of HISTORIC proportions !
I am thrilled to announce that in the second quarter of this year, the  US  Economy grew at the amazing rate of 4 . 1% !

@JohnJamesMI, who is running in the Republican Primary in the great state of Michigan, is SPECTACULAR !  Vote on August 7th .  Rarely have I seen a candidate with such great potential .  West Point graduate, successful businessman and a African American leader …
GREAT GDP numbers just released .  Will be having a news conference soon !
… I did NOT know of the meeting with my son, Don jr .  Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe ? ) .  He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary's lawyer .  Gee, I wonder if they helped him make the choice !
… ,the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats, so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues !  How stupid and unfair to our Country … And so the Fake News doesn't waste my time with dumb questions, NO, …
Arrived back in Washington last night from a very emotional reopening of a major  US  Steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, only to be greeted with the ridiculous news that the highly conflicted Robert Mueller and his gang of 13 Angry Democrats obviously cannot find Collusion …
Way to go Jerry .  This is what the league should do !
The Remains of American Servicemen will soon be leaving North Korea and heading to the United States !  After so many years, this will be a great moment for so many families .  Thank you to Kim Jong Un .
America is OPEN FOR BUSINESS and  US  Steel is back !
… called The Case Against Impeaching Trump, which I would encourage all people with Trump Derangement Syndrome to read !
@AlanDersh, a brilliant lawyer, who although a Liberal Democrat who probably didn't vote for me, has discussed the Witch Hunt with great clarity and in a very positive way .  He has written a new and very important book …
PROMISES KEPT !
Thank you @U_S_Steel and Granite City, Illinois !
The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson, a great Christian, family man and wonderful human being .  He is suffering greatly .  This innocent man of faith should be released immediately !
This is great - on my way, see you soon @IAGovernor Kim Reynolds !
Heading to Dubuque, Iowa and then Granite City, Illinois .  Looking  forward to being with many great friends !
Twitter SHADOW BANNING prominent Republicans .  Not good .  We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once !  Many complaints .
European Union representatives told me that they would start buying soybeans from our great farmers immediately .  Also, they will be buying vast amounts of LNG !
Great to be back on track with the European Union .  This was a big day for free and fair trade !
Thank you Georgia !  They say that my endorsement last week of Brian Kemp, in the Republican Primary for Governor against a very worthy opponent, lifted him from 5 points down to a 70% to 30% victory !  Two very good and talented men in a great race, but congratulations to Brian !
Obviously the European Union, as represented by @JunckerEU and the United States, as represented by yours truly, love each other !
… along quickly .  European Union Nations will be open to the United States and at the same time benefiting by everything we are doing for them .  There was great warmth and feeling in the room - a breakthrough has been quickly made that nobody thought possible !
Great meeting on Trade today with @JunckerEU and representatives of the European Union .  We have come to a very strong understanding and are all believers in no tariffs, no barriers and no subsidies .  Work on documents has already started and the process is moving …
Thank you very much, working hard !
Sergio Marchionne, who passed away today, was one of the most brilliant & successful car executives since the days of the legendary Henry Ford .  It was a great honor for me to get to know Sergio as POTUS, he loved the car industry, and fought hard for it .  He will be truly missed !
This week, my Administration is hosting the first-ever #IRFMinisterial .  The  US  will continue to promote #ReligiousFreedom around the world .  Nations that support religious freedom are far more free, prosperous & peaceful .  Great job, @VP, @SecPompeo, @IRF_Ambassador & @StateDept !
The United States and the European Union have a $1 TRILLION bilateral trade relationship – the largest economic relationship in the world .  We want to further strengthen this trade relationship to the benefit of all American and European citizens …
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night .  Wow, 69-30, those are big numbers .  Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you .  She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment .  Win !
What kind of a lawyer would tape a client ?  So sad !  Is this a first, never heard of it before ?  Why was the tape so abruptly terminated (cut) while I was presumably saying positive things ?  I hear there are other clients and many reporters that are taped - can this be so ?  Too bad !
China is targeting our farmers, who they know I love & respect, as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the  US  They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt .  We were being nice - until now !  China made $517 Billion on us last year .
When you have people snipping at your heels during a negotiation, it will only take longer to make a deal, and the deal will never be as good as it could have been with unity .  Negotiations are going really well, be cool .  The end result will be worth it !
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking ?  Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off ?   Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year .  No weakness !
The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump is a Hot Seller, already Number One !  More importantly, it is a great book that everyone is talking about .  It covers the Rigged Witch Hunt brilliantly .  Congratulations to Gregg Jarrett !
So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn't approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune .  This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People .  Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved, much bigger, but not Sinclair .  Disgraceful !
The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade .  I have an idea for them .  Both the  US  and the E . U .  drop all Tariffs, Barriers and Subsidies !  That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade !  Hope they do it, we are ready - but they won't !
Today, it was my great honor to be in Kansas City, Missouri to pay tribute to the men and women who make FREEDOM possible !  Thank you @VFWHQ !  #VFWConvention
On the heels of the VERY successful launch of the @WhiteHouse National Council for the American Worker, Congress should reauthorize #PerkinsCTE and ensure the American workforce remains stronger than EVER !  #Jobs #Workforce
I want to thank the @VFWHQ for your devotion to our fallen heroes, unknown soldiers, Prisoners of War, those Missing in Action, and their families .  #VFWConvention
#VFWConvention @VFWHQ
I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election .  Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats .  They definitely don't want Trump !
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Heading to Missouri to be with many of my great friends .  VFW here we come !
Our Country is doing GREAT .  Best financial numbers on the Planet .  Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN !
Today is the day to vote for Brian Kemp .  Will be great for Georgia, full Endorsement !
Tariffs are the greatest !  Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal, or it gets hit with Tariffs .  It's as simple as that - and everybody's talking !  Remember, we are the piggy bank that's being robbed .  All will be Great !
Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate .  This should have taken place many years ago but,
as the saying goes, better late than never !
#MadeInAmerica Showcase !
Lou Barletta was one of my first supporters .  He is tough on Crime and Borders .  Will be a great Senator from Pennsylvania .  His opponent is WEAK on Crime, ICE and Borders .  We need Lou !
Robert will do a great job for our Vets .  We also recently won Choice !
… In my opinion the Washington Post is nothing more than an expensive (the paper loses a fortune) lobbyist for Amazon .  Is it used as protection against antitrust claims which many feel should be brought ?
The Amazon Washington Post has gone crazy against me ever since they lost the Internet Tax Case in the  US  Supreme Court two months ago .  Next up is the  US  Post Office which they use, at a fraction of real cost, as their delivery boy for a BIG percentage of their packages …
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months .  Likewise, no Nuclear Tests .  Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy .  But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough .  Wrong, very happy !
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin, and all that I gave up, remember, I gave up NOTHING, we merely talked about future benefits for both countries .  Also, we got along very well, which is a good thing, except for the Corrupt Media !
… Carter Page wasn't a spy, wasn't an agent of the Russians - he would have cooperated with the FBI .  It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump .  Tom Fitton @JudicialWatch A disgrace to America .  They should drop the discredited Mueller Witch Hunt now !
… and the DOJ, FBI and Obama Gang need to be held to account .  Source #1 was the major source .  Avoided talking about it being the Clinton campaign behind it .  Misled the Court to provide a pretext to SPY on the Trump Team .  Not about Carter Page .  . was all about getting Trump …
It was classified to cover up misconduct by the FBI and the Justice Department in misleading the Court by using this Dossier in a dishonest way to gain a warrant to target the Trump Team .  This is a Clinton Campaign document .  It was a fraud and a hoax designed to target Trump …
So we now find out that it was indeed the unverified and Fake Dirty Dossier, that was paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC, that was knowingly & falsely submitted to FISA and which was responsible for starting the totally conflicted and discredited Mueller Witch Hunt !
Tom Fitton on @foxandfriends at 6 : 15  AM  NOW !  Judicial Watch .
To Iranian President Rouhani :  NEVER, EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE .  WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH .  BE CAUTIOUS !
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election .  Why didn't he do something about it ?  Why didn't he tell our campaign ?  Because it is all a big hoax, that's why, and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win !  !  !
Happy Birthday @SenatorDole !
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it .  So bad for our country !
@PeteHegseth on @FoxNews  Source #1 was the (Fake) Dossier .  Yes, the Dirty Dossier, paid for by Democrats as a hit piece against Trump, and looking for information that could discredit Candidate #1 Trump .  Carter Page was just the foot to surveil the Trump campaign …  ILLEGAL !
Andrew McCarthy - I said this could never happen .  This is so bad that they should be looking at the judges who signed off on this stuff, not just the people who gave it .  It is so bad it screams out at you .   On the whole FISA scam which led to the rigged Mueller Witch Hunt !
Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC .  Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie .  Republicans must get tough now .  An illegal Scam !
Congratulations to @JudicialWatch and @TomFitton on being successful in getting the Carter Page FISA documents .  As usual they are ridiculously heavily redacted but confirm with little doubt that the Department of Justice and FBI misled the courts .  Witch Hunt Rigged, a Scam !
Watching Los Angeles possible hostage situation very closely .  Active barricaded suspect .  L . A . P . D .  working with Federal Law Enforcement .
Troy Balderson of Ohio is running for Congress against a Nancy Pelosi Liberal who is WEAK on Crime & Borders .  Troy is the total opposite, and loves our Military, Vets & 2nd Amendment .  EARLY VOTING just started with Election Day on August 7th .  Troy has my Full & Total Endorsement !

No Collusion, No Obstruction - but that doesn't matter because the 13 Angry Democrats, who are only after Republicans and totally protecting Democrats, want this Witch Hunt to drag out to the November Election .  Republicans better get smart fast and expose what they are doing !
The Rigged Witch Hunt, headed by the 13 Angry Democrats (and now 4 more have been added, one who worked directly for Obama W . H . ), seems intent on damaging the Republican Party's chances in the November Election .  This Democrat excuse for losing the ‘16 Election never ends !
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer's office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of .  Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal .  The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong !
The NFL National Anthem Debate is alive and well again - can't believe it !  Isn't it in contract that players must stand at attention, hand on heart ?  The $40,000,000 Commissioner must now make a stand .  First time kneeling, out for game .  Second time kneeling, out for season/no pay !
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin .  In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy .  If I was loud & vicious, I would have been criticized for being too tough .  Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim ?  Hypocrites !
So important .  Should have been done years ago !
Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years .  The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election .  A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries .  They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers .  Canada charges 275% on Dairy .  Farmers will WIN !
… The United States should not be penalized because we are doing so well .  Tightening now hurts all that we have done .  The  US  should be allowed to recapture what was lost due to illegal currency manipulation and BAD Trade Deals .  Debt coming due & we are raising rates - Really ?
China, the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower, while the  US  is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge .  As usual, not a level playing field …
My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri .  Such a tragedy, such a great loss .  May God be with you all !
Will the Dems and Fake News ever learn ?  This is classic !
Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES
… proliferation, cyber attacks, trade, Ukraine, Middle East peace, North Korea and more .  There are many answers, some easy and some hard, to these problems … but they can ALL be solved !
Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES .
The Summit with Russia was a great success, except with the real enemy of the people, the Fake News Media .  I look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed, including stopping terrorism, security for Israel, nuclear …
I told you so !  The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies, Google .  They truly have taken advantage of the  US , but not for long !
Really big jobs meeting today at the White House !  3  PM
Trump recognized Russian Meddling MANY TIMES .  Thank you to @foxandfriends and @FoxNews for actually showing the clips .  The Fake News wants no part of that narrative !  Too bad they don't want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set .
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia, even a confrontation that could lead to war .  They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I'll probably have a good relationship with Putin .  We are doing MUCH better than any other country !
The Fake News Media is going Crazy !  They make up stories without any backup, sources or proof .  Many of the stories written about me, and the good people surrounding me, are total fiction .  Problem is, when you complain you just give them more publicity .  But I'll complain anyway !
The Democrats have a death wish, in more ways than one - they actually want to abolish ICE .  This should cost them heavily in the Midterms .  Yesterday, the Republicans overwhelmingly passed a bill supporting ICE !
Thank you to Novartis for not increasing your prices on prescription drugs .  Likewise to Pfizer .  We are making a big push to actually reduce the prices, maybe substantially, on prescription drugs .
A total disgrace that Turkey will not release a respected  US  Pastor, Andrew Brunson, from prison .  He has been held hostage far too long .  @RT_Erdogan should do something to free this wonderful Christian husband & father .  He has done nothing wrong, and his family needs him !
The two biggest opponents of ICE in America today are the Democratic Party and MS-13 !
Thank you to Congressman Kevin Yoder !  He secured $5 BILLION for Border Security .  Now we need Congress to support .  Kevin has been strong on Crime, the Border, the 2nd Amendment, and he loves our Military and Vets .  @RepKevinYoder has my full and total endorsement !
Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia .  The Primary is on Tuesday .  Brian is tough on crime, strong on the border and illegal immigration .  He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment .  I give him my full and total endorsement .
3 . 4 million jobs created since our great Election Victory - far greater than ever anticipated, and only getting better as new and greatly improved Trade Deals start coming to fruition !
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia .  They would rather go to war than see this .  It's called Trump Derangement Syndrome !
A lot of Democrats wished they voted for the Tax Cuts because the economy is booming - we could have 4% growth now and the Fed said yesterday that unemployment could drop again .   @foxandfriends  @kilmeade
Congratulations to Martha Roby of The Great State of Alabama on her big GOP Primary win for Congress .  My endorsement came appropriately late, but when it came the flood gates opened and you had the kind of landslide victory that you deserve .  Enjoy !
… Russia has agreed to help with North Korea, where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along .  There is no rush, the sanctions remain !  Big benefits and exciting future for North Korea at end of process !
While the NATO meeting in Brussels was an acknowledged triumph, with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace, the meeting with Russia may prove to be, in the long run, an even greater success .  Many positive things will come out of that meeting .  .
So many people at the higher ends of intelligence loved my press conference performance in Helsinki .  Putin and I discussed many important subjects at our earlier meeting .  We got along well which truly bothered many haters who wanted to see a boxing match .  Big results will come !
Prosperity is returning .  Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate, now as the most effective president, the most successful president, in modern American history .  Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs !
The Democrats want to abolish ICE, which will mean more crime in our country .  I want to give ICE a big cheer !  Vote Republican in November .
The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success, except in the Fake News Media !
The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before !
Thank you @RandPaul .  The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed to think ?
While I had a great meeting with NATO, raising vast amounts of money, I had an even better meeting with Vladimir Putin of Russia .  Sadly, it is not being reported that way - the Fake News is going Crazy !
I had a great meeting with NATO .  They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future, only because of me .  NATO was weak, but now it is strong again (bad for Russia) .  The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money !
Thank you @RandPaul, you really get it !  The President has gone through a year and a half of totally partisan investigations - what's he supposed think ?
Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9pmE and @TuckerCarlson tomorrow night at 8pmE .  Enjoy !
A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world .  #HELSINKI2018
I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of peace, than to risk peace in pursuit of politics .  #HELSINKI2018
As I said today and many times before, I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people .  However, I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future, we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world's two largest nuclear powers, we must get along !  #HELSINKI2018
Thank you Helsinki, Finland !
Joint Press Conference from Helsinki, Finland :
It was an honor to join you this morning .  Thank you !
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of  US  foolishness and stupidity and now, the Rigged Witch Hunt !
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling, he said it couldn't happen, was no big deal, & did NOTHING about it .  When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok !
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations, both present & future .  We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media .  NATO is now strong & rich !
Congratulations to France, who played extraordinary soccer, on winning the 2018 World Cup .  Additionally, congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever !
… know how to do is resist and obstruct !  This is why there is such hatred and dissension in our country – but at some point, it will heal !
… over the years, I would return to criticism that it wasn't good enough – that I should have gotten Saint Petersburg in addition !  Much of our news media is indeed the enemy of the people and all the Dems …
Heading to Helsinki, Finland – looking forward to meeting with President Putin tomorrow .  Unfortunately, no matter how well I do at the Summit, if I was given the great city of Moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by Russia …
There hasn't been a missile or rocket fired in 9 months in North Korea, there have been no nuclear tests and we got back our hostages .  Who knows how it will all turn out in the end, but why isn't the Fake News talking about these wonderful facts ?  Because it is FAKE NEWS !
These Russian individuals did their work during the Obama years .  Why didn't Obama do something about it ?   Because he thought Crooked Hillary Clinton would win, that's why .  Had nothing to do with the Trump Administration, but Fake News doesn't want to report the truth, as usual !
Our prayers are with those affected by the flooding in Japan .  We commend the rescue efforts and offer condolences to all who were injured or lost loved ones .
… Remember, it was Little Jeff Z and his people, who are told exactly what to say, who said I could not win the election in that there was no way to 270 (over & over again) in the Electoral College .  I got 306 !  They were sooooo wrong in their election coverage .  Still hurting !
So funny !  I just checked out Fake News CNN, for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings), to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy) .  They didn't !  But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin .  Fake News …
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administration .  Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election ?
… Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't the FBI take possession of it ?  Deep State ?
The stories you heard about the 12 Russians yesterday took place during the Obama Administration, not the Trump Administrations .  Why didn't they do something about it, especially when it was reported that President Obama was informed by the FBI in September, before the Election ?
The Stock Market hit 25,000 yesterday .  Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government .  It is all happening !
I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings, calls and hopefully, some golf - my primary form of exercise !  The weather is beautiful, and this place is incredible !  Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin .
This is now changing - for the first time !
🇺🇸🇬🇧
Joint Press Conference with Prime Minister Theresa May …
Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress .  Strong on Crime, the Border, Illegal Immigration, the 2nd Amendment, our great Military & Vets, Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts .  He has my Full Endorsement !
Great success today at NATO !  Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election .  Great spirit !
A very nice note from Chairman Kim of North Korea .  Great progress being made !
Trump has been the most consequential president in history when it comes to minority employment .  In June, for instance, the unemployment rate for Hispanics and Latinos 16 years and older fell to 4 . 6%, its lowest level ever, from 4 . 9% in May .
Thank you #NATO2018 !
#NATOSummit2018 Press Conference in Brussels, Belgium :
… On top of it all, Germany just started paying Russia, the country they want protection from, Billions of Dollars for their Energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from Russia .  Not acceptable !  All NATO Nations must meet their 2% commitment, and that must ultimately go to 4% !
Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia .  They pay only a fraction of their cost .  The  US  pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe, and loses Big on Trade !
As I head out to a very important NATO meeting, I see that FBI Lover/Agent Lisa Page is dodging a Subpoena & is refusing to show up and testify .  What can she possibly say about her statements and lies .  So much corruption on the other side .  Where is the Attorney General ?  @FoxNews
Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year, at my request, but it isn't nearly enough .   US  spends too much .  Europe's borders are BAD !  Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable !
How can the Rigged Witch Hunt proceed when it was started, influenced and worked on, for an extended period of time, by former FBI Agent/Lover Peter Strzok ?  Read his hate filled and totally biased Emails and the answer is clear !
Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress !  Wow, but is anybody really surprised !   Together with her lover, FBI Agent Peter Strzok, she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt, perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER !
If the Democrats want to win Supreme Court and other Court picks, don't Obstruct and Resist, but rather do it the good ol' fashioned way, WIN ELECTIONS !
What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy ?  Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment ?  The  US  is paying for Europe's protection, then loses billions on Trade .  Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025 .

Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now .  I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix .  Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works .  They are just using children !
… things up, better than ever before, but it can't go too quickly .  I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers, and will win !
I am in Brussels, but always thinking about our farmers .  Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election .  Farmers have done poorly for 15 years .  Other countries' trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses .  I will open …
Bilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels, Belgium …
Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint .  Pfizer is rolling back price hikes, so American patients don't pay more .  We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same .  Great news for the American people !
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe ( US  has a $151 Billion trade deficit), and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO, and nicely pay for it .  Just doesn't work !
A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans, especially Hispanics, feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama .
Many countries in NATO, which we are expected to defend, are not only short of their current commitment of 2% (which is low), but are also delinquent for many years in payments that have not been made .  Will they reimburse the  US  ?
Informing the Republican Senators of my nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh .  #SCOTUS
I am on Air Force One flying to NATO and hear reports that the FBI lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page are getting cold feet on testifying about  the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by 13 Angry Democrats and people that worked for Obama for 8 years .  Total disgrace !
On behalf of the United States, congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand .  Such a beautiful moment - all freed, great job !
Thank you to all of my great supporters, really big progress being made .  Other countries wanting to fix crazy trade deals .  Economy is ROARING .  Supreme Court pick getting GREAT REVIEWS .  New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in history of the Party .  Wow !
NATO countries must pay MORE, the United States must pay LESS .  Very Unfair !
Getting ready to leave for Europe .  First meeting - NATO .  The  US  is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them .  Not fair to the  US  taxpayer .  On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union .  Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers) !
Tonight, it was my honor and privilege to nominate Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court .  #SCOTUS
HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY to our amazing current and former Army Warrant Officers .  Thank you for your century of service, as the indispensable guardians of our great @USArmy's technology !  #CenturyOfService
Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason .  They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves, while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere .  We will respond !
The failing NY Times Fake News story today about breast feeding must be called out .  The  US  strongly supports breast feeding but we don't believe women should be denied access to formula .  Many women need this option because of malnutrition and poverty .
I have confidence that Kim Jong Un will honor the contract we signed &, even more importantly, our handshake .  We agreed to the denuclearization of North Korea .  China, on the other hand, may be exerting negative pressure on a deal because of our posture on Chinese Trade-Hope Not !
I have long heard that the most important decision a  US  President can make is the selection of a Supreme Court Justice - Will be announced tonight at 9 : 00  PM
… Europe far more than it does the  US  By some accounts, the  US  is paying for 90% of NATO, with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment .  On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the  US , with big Trade Barriers on  US  goods .  NO !
The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country .  This is not fair, nor is it acceptable .  While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office, they must do much more .  Germany is at 1%, the  US  is at 4%, and NATO benefits …
They just didn't get it, but they do now !
Looking forward to announcing my final decision on the United States Supreme Court Justice at 9 : 00pmE tomorrow night at the @WhiteHouse .  An exceptional person will be chosen !

The  US  is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety .  Very brave and talented people !
The Rigged Witch Hunt, originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now, 13 Angry Democrats, should look into the missing DNC Server, Crooked Hillary's illegally deleted Emails, the Pakistani Fraudster, Uranium One, Podesta & so much more .  It's a Democrat Con Job !
Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the Special Counsel because the public understands that there was no  Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous), that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems !

Big decision will soon be made on our next Justice of the Supreme Court !
Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace .  Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon, the Washington Post, who constantly quote anonymous sources that, in my opinion, don't exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years !
Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others), colluded with Russia .  They haven't figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election !
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !
Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, America is WINNING AGAIN - and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world .  Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST !
Every day, the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13 .  We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement .  We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL !
A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities, to let drugs pour into our cities, and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans .  Democrats want anarchy, amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW, ORDER and JUSTICE !
It was my great honor to join proud, hardworking American Patriots in Montana tonight .  I love you - thank you !  #MAGA
… on Monday assume duties as the acting Administrator of the EPA .  I have no doubt that Andy will continue on with our great and lasting EPA agenda .  We have made tremendous progress and the future of the EPA is very bright !
I have accepted the resignation of Scott Pruitt as the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency .  Within the Agency Scott has done an outstanding job, and I will always be thankful to him for this .  The Senate confirmed Deputy at EPA, Andrew Wheeler, will …
Congress - FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW !
… Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial .  Tell the people OUT, and they must leave, just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn .  Hiring thousands of judges does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this !
Congress must pass smart, fast and reasonable Immigration Laws now .  Law Enforcement at the Border is doing a great job, but the laws they are forced to work with are insane .  When people, with or without children, enter our Country, they must be told to leave without our …
Happy Birthday, America !
The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help .  If anything, they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $'s .  This must be a two way street .  REDUCE PRICING NOW !

Happy Fourth of July … Our Country is doing GREAT !
Tomorrow, families across our Nation will gather to celebrate the Fourth of July .  As we do, we will think of the men & women serving overseas at this very moment, far away from their families, protecting America - & we will thank GOD for blessing us with these incredible HEROES !
… has endured because of the sweat, blood and sacrifice of the American Armed Forces – the greatest force for peace and justice in the history of the world !
Tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible :  our brave service members, and our wonderful Veterans .  For 242 years, American Independence …
Thank you, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, for that warm introduction .  Tonight, it was my great honor to attend the Greenbrier Classic – Salute to Service Dinner in West Virginia !  God Bless our Veterans .  God Bless America - and HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO ALL !
After having written many best selling books, and somewhat priding myself on my ability to write, it should be noted that the Fake News constantly likes to pore over my tweets looking for a mistake .  I capitalize certain words only for emphasis, not b/c they should be capitalized !
Just arrived in West Virginia !
The Washington Post is constantly quoting anonymous sources that do not exist .  Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for .  They are a disgrace to journalism but then again, so are many others !
Heading to West Virginia to be with my friend, @WVGovernor Jim Justice, at his beautiful Greenbrier Resort .  He works hard, does a great job, and raises lots of money for charities !

Wow !  The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages .  Privacy violations ?  They blame technical irregularities .  Such a disgrace .  The Witch Hunt continues !
Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the  US , my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the  US  Harley customers are not happy with their move - sales are down 7% in 2017 .  The  US  is where the Action is !
Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians - including to government officials .  How big (and bad) is that ?
Many good conversations with North Korea-it is going well !  In the meantime, no Rocket Launches or Nuclear Testing in 8 months .  All of Asia is thrilled .  Only the Opposition Party, which includes the Fake News, is complaining .  If not for me, we would now be at War with North Korea !
How can the Democrats, who are weak on the Border and weak on Crime, do well in November .  The people of our Country want and demand Safety and Security, while the Democrats are more interested in  ripping apart and demeaning (and not properly funding) our great Law Enforcement !
When we have an infestation of MS-13 GANGS in certain parts of our country, who do we send to get them out ?  ICE !  They are tougher and smarter than these rough criminal elelments that bad immigration laws allow into our country .  Dems do not appreciate the great job they do !  Nov .
The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before, and that's prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country .  In any event, they are coming along very well .  Most countries agree that they must be changed, but nobody ever asked !
I interviewed 4 very impressive people yesterday .  On Monday I will be announcing my decision for Justice of the United States Supreme Court !
Crazy Maxine Waters, said by some to be one of the most corrupt people in politics, is rapidly becoming, together with Nancy Pelosi, the FACE of the Democrat Party .  Her ranting and raving, even referring to herself as a wounded animal, will make people flee the Democrats !
Many Democrats are deeply concerned about the fact that their leadership wants to denounce and abandon the great men and women of ICE, thereby declaring war on Law & Order .  These people will be voting for Republicans in November and, in many cases, joining the Republican Party !
Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands, to the @WhiteHouse !
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico .  I look very much forward to working with him .  There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico !
A big week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court .  Heading back to the White House now .  Focus will be on the selection of a new Supreme Court Justice .  Exciting times for our country .  Economy may be stronger than it has ever been !
The Liberal Left, also known as the Democrats, want to get rid of ICE, who do a fantastic job, and want Open Borders .  Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable !  Make America Great Again
I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo at 10 : 00  AM  on @FoxNews
When people come into our Country illegally, we must IMMEDIATELY escort them back out without going through years of legal maneuvering .  Our laws are the dumbest anywhere in the world .  Republicans want Strong Borders and no Crime .  Dems want Open Borders and are weak on Crime !
I will be interviewed by @MariaBartiromo on Sunday on @FoxNews at 10 : 00 A .  M .  Enjoy !
Either we need to elect more Republicans in November or Republicans must end the ridiculous 60 vote, or Filibuster, rule - or better yet, do both .  Cryin' Chuck would do it on day one, but we'll never give him the chance .  Some great legislation awaits - be smart !
I never pushed the Republicans in the House to vote for the Immigration Bill, either GOODLATTE 1 or 2, because it could never have gotten enough Democrats as long as there is the 60 vote threshold .  I released many prior to the vote knowing we need more Republicans to win in Nov .
A friend of mine and a man who has truly seen politics and life as few others ever will, Sean Spicer, has written a great new book, The Briefing :  Politics, the Press and the President .  It is a story told with both heart and knowledge .  Really good, go get it !
I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on the first Monday after the July 4th Holiday, July 9th !
Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that, because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela, I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production, maybe up to 2,000,000 barrels, to make up the difference … Prices to high !  He has agreed !
To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit .  You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements .  So brave !  The radical left Dems want you out .  Next it will be all police .  Zero chance, It will never happen !
The Democrats are making a strong push to abolish ICE, one of the smartest, toughest and most spirited law enforcement groups of men and women that I have ever seen .  I have watched ICE liberate towns from the grasp of MS-13 & clean out the toughest of situations .  They are great !
The new plant being built by Foxconn in Wisconsin is incredible .  Congratulations to the people of Wisconsin and to Governor Scott Walker @GovWalker and his talented representatives for having pulled it off .  Great job !

Before going any further today, I want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland .  This attack shocked the conscience of our Nation, and filled our hearts with grief …
Prior to departing Wisconsin, I was briefed on the shooting at Capital Gazette in Annapolis, Maryland .  My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families .  Thank you to all of the First Responders who are currently on the scene .
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS !
Today, we broke ground on a plant that will provide jobs for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers !  As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States !
I am in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for meetings .  Soon to leave for a big groundbreaking for Foxconn, which is building a great new electronics plant in Wisconsin .  15,000 Jobs, so great !

Peter Strzok worked as the leader of the Rigged Witch Hunt for a long period of time - he got it started and was only fired because the gig was up .  But remember, he took his orders from Comey and McCabe and they took their orders from you know who .  Mueller/Comey best friends !
Just watched @SharkGregNorman on @foxandfriends .  Said President is doing a great job .  All over the world, people want to come back to the  US  Thank you Greg, and you're looking and doing great !
Amy Kremer, Women for Trump, was so great on @foxandfriends .  Brave and very smart, thank you Amy !  @AmyKremer
Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election !  Where is the DNC Server, and why didn't Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it ?  Why isn't Hillary/Russia being looked at ?  So many questions, so much corruption !
Lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok was given poor marks on yesterday's closed door testimony and, according to most reports, refused to answer many questions .  There was no Collusion and the Witch Hunt, headed by 13 Angry Democrats and others who are totally conflicted, is Rigged !
… home addresses – putting these selfless public servants in harm's way .  These radical protesters want ANARCHY – but the only response they will find from our government is LAW AND ORDER !
In recent days we have heard shameless attacks on our courageous law enforcement officers .  Extremist Democrat politicians have called for the complete elimination of ICE .  Leftwing Activists are trying to block ICE officers from doing their jobs and publicly posting their …
Thank you North Dakota .  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN !  #MAGA
Just landed in North Dakota with @SenJohnHoeven and @RepKevinCramer .  We will see everyone at Scheels Arena shortly !
Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa of Portugal to the @WhiteHouse ! 🇺🇸🇵🇹
Heading to North Dakota to fully stand with and endorse Kevin Cramer for Senate .  He is an extraordinary Congressman who will hopefully soon represent this great state as your Senator .  He is tough on crime, strong on borders, loves our Military, and our Vets !  #NDSen
Statement on Justice Anthony Kennedy .  #SCOTUS
Today, I was thrilled to join student leaders from Colleges and Universities across the country …
Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America, with the people that got you your success .  I've done so much for you, and then this .  Other companies are coming back where they belong !  We won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors !
Supreme Court rules in favor of non-union workers who are now, as an example, able to support a candidate of his or her choice without having those who control the Union deciding for them .  Big loss for the coffers of the Democrats !
HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL, KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II, IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY, EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON'T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE .  PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS & SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME .   WIN !
Congratulations to Maxine Waters, whose crazy rants have made her, together with Nancy Pelosi, the unhinged FACE of the Democrat Party .  Together, they will Make America Weak Again !  But have no fear, America is now stronger than ever before, and I'm not going anywhere !
Big and conclusive win by Mitt Romney .  Congratulations !  I look forward to working together - there is so much good to do .  A great and loving family will be coming to  DC
The legendary Gary Player at Turnberry in Scotland !
A great First Lady !
The Democrats are in Turmoil !  Open Borders and unchecked Crime a certain way to lose elections .  Republicans are for Strong Borders, NO Crime !  A BIG NIGHT !
Wow !  Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley, who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi's place, just LOST his primary election .  In other words, he's out !  That is a big one that nobody saw happening .  Perhaps he should have been nicer, and more respectful, to his President !
Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan .  You showed great courage in a tough race !  New York, and my many friends on Staten Island, have elected someone they have always been very proud of .  Congratulations !
Congratulations to Governor Henry McMaster on your BIG election win !  South Carolina loves you .  We are all proud of you and Peggy !  @henrymcmaster
Today, we tell the story of an incredible HERO who defended our nation in World War Two – First Lieutenant Garlin Murl Conner .  Although he died 20 years ago, today he takes his rightful place in the Eternal Chronicle of American Valor …
SUPREME COURT UPHOLDS TRUMP TRAVEL BAN .  Wow !
The most profound question of our era :  Was there a conspiracy in the Obama Department of Justice and the FBI to prevent Donald Trump from becoming President of the  US , and was Strzok at the core of the conspiracy ?   Judge Andrew Napolitano
The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who, together with Nancy Pelosi, have established a fine leadership team .  They should always stay together and lead the Democrats, who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime, well into the future … and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres .
A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never !  Their employees and customers are already very angry at them .  If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit !  The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before !
It was great being with Governor Henry McMaster last night in South Carolina .  Henry is tough on Crime and Borders, loves our Military and our Vets and has created many jobs and a great economy .  GO OUT AND VOTE FOR HENRY TODAY, HE WILL NEVER LET YOU DOWN !
… We are finishing our study of Tariffs on cars from the E . U .  in that they have long taken advantage of the  US  in the form of Trade Barriers and Tariffs .  In the end it will all even out - and it won't take very long !
… When I had Harley-Davidson officials over to the White House, I chided them about tariffs in other countries, like India, being too high .  Companies are now coming back to America .  Harley must know that they won't be able to sell back into  US  without paying a big tax !
… We are getting other countries to reduce and eliminate tariffs and trade barriers that have been unfairly used for years against our farmers, workers and companies .  We are opening up closed markets and expanding our footprint .  They must play fair or they will pay tariffs !
Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand .  That was long before Tariffs were announced .  Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse .  Shows how unbalanced & unfair trade is, but we will fix it …
Thank you South Carolina .  Now let's get out tomorrow and VOTE for @HenryMcMaster !
Just landed in South Carolina - will be at the McMaster rally shortly !  #MAGA
The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television, not a closed door hearing that nobody will see .  We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency !
Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA), perhaps in a near drunken state, claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller, the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt, knows ?  Isn't this highly illegal .  Is it being investigated ?
Director David Lynch :  Trump Could Go Down as One of the Greatest Presidents
Surprised that Harley-Davidson, of all companies, would be the first to wave the White Flag .  I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E . U . , which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion .  Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient !   #MAGA
Congresswoman Maxine Waters, an extraordinarily low IQ person, has become, together with Nancy Pelosi, the Face of the Democrat Party .  She has just called for harm to supporters, of which there are many, of the Make America Great Again movement .  Be careful what you wish for Max !
Will be heading to one of my favorite places, South Carolina, to fight for one of my original fighters, Governor Henry McMaster .  Speaking at 7 : 00  PM
… If this is done, illegal immigration will be stopped in it's tracks - and at very little, by comparison, cost .  This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL !
Hiring manythousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional .  People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the  US  illegally .  Children brought back to their country …
Such a difference in the media coverage of the same immigration policies between the Obama Administration and ours .  Actually, we have done a far better job in that our facilities are cleaner and better run than were the facilities under Obama .  Fake News is working overtime !
I have tried to stay uninvolved with the Department of Justice and FBI (although I do not legally have to), because of the now totally discredited and very expensive Witch Hunt currently going on .  But you do have to ask why the DOJ & FBI aren't giving over requested documents ?
The Red Hen Restaurant should focus more on cleaning its filthy canopies, doors and windows (badly needs a paint job) rather than refusing to serve a fine person like Sarah Huckabee Sanders .  I always had a rule, if a restaurant is dirty on the outside, it is dirty on the inside !
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower .  Actually, far greater than would ever have been believed !
@RepClayHiggins has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for Border Security, our Military and are Vets .  He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement .  The Great State of Louisiana, we want Clay !
House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember, it still has to pass in the Senate, and for that we need 10 Democrat votes, and all they do is RESIST .  They want Open Borders and don't care about Crime !  Need more Republicans to WIN in November !
@ClayHiggins18 has been a great help to me on Cutting Taxes, creating great new healthcare programs at low cost, fighting for Border Security, our Military and are Vets .  He is tough on Crime and has my full Endorsement .  The Great State of Louisiana, we want Clay !
@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous hair show with me (where he seriously messed up my hair), & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have humanized me-he is taking heat .  He called & said monster ratings .  Be a man Jimmy !
The United States is insisting that all countries that have placed artificial Trade Barriers and Tariffs on goods going into their country, remove those Barriers & Tariffs or be met with more than Reciprocity by the  USA  Trade must be fair and no longer a one way street !
… Our Immigration policy, laughed at all over the world, is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years !  Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again !
We cannot allow all of these people to invade our Country .  When somebody comes in, we must immediately, with no Judges or Court Cases, bring them back from where they came .  Our system is a mockery to good immigration policy and Law and Order .  Most children come without parents …
Democrats, fix the laws .  Don't RESIST .  We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need strength and security at the Border !  Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country .  Strong Borders, No Crime !
Major Wall Street Journal opinion piece today talking about the Russian Witch Hunt and the disgrace that it is .  So many people hurt, so bad for our country - a total sham !
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS !
Thank you @NVGOP !  #MAGA
Happy Birthday to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a friend and great man !
It's very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country .  The United States cannot stand for this .  We wants safety and security at our borders !
Heading to Nevada to talk trade and immigration with supporters .  Country's economy is stronger than ever before with numbers that are getting better by the week .  Tremendous potential, and trade deals are coming along well .
My thoughts and prayers are with Representative Katie Arrington of South Carolina, including all of those involved in last nights car accident, and their families .
… everyone how much he likes me, but he will only vote with Nancy Pelosi .  Keith is strong on borders and tough on crime — and loves cutting taxes !  #MAGA
@VP Pence is heading to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania where we have both strongly endorsed one of the finest men around, Congressman Keith @RothfusForPA .  He is running against #LambTheSham, who is telling …
Drudge Report  OBAMA KEPT THEM IN CAGES, WRAPPED THEM IN FOIL We do a much better job while at the same time maintaining a MUCH stronger Border !  Mainstream Fake Media hates this story .
Disability applications plunge as economy strengthens  Failing New York Times
The National Association of Manufacturers just announced that 95 . 1% of Manufacturers have a positive outlook for their companies .   This is the best number in the Association's history !
The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged !
@FoxNews  Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt .  With all of the bias, lying and hate by the investigators, people want the investigators investigated .  Much more will come out .  A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election !
Steel is coming back fast !   US  Steel is adding great capacity also .  So are others .
Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the  US  & its great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the  US  Build them here !
Our first duty, and our highest loyalty, is to the citizens of the United States .  We will not rest until our border is secure, our citizens are safe, and we finally end the immigration crisis once and for all .
We are gathered today to hear directly from the AMERICAN VICTIMS of ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION .  These are the American Citizens permanently separated from their loved ones b/c they were killed by criminal illegal aliens .  These are the families the media ignores …
Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the  US  and it great companies and workers by the European Union, if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed, we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the  US  Build them here !
Hope OPEC will increase output substantially .  Need to keep prices down !
We must maintain a Strong Southern Border .  We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief, hoping it will help them in the elections .  Obama and others had the same pictures, and did nothing about it !
80% of Mexico's Exports come to the United States .  They totally rely on us, which is fine with me .  They do have, though, very strong Immigration Laws .  The  US  has pathetically weak and ineffective Immigration Laws that the Democrats refuse to help us fix .  Will speak to Mexico !
Congressman Ron DeSantis, a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School, is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida .  Ron is strong on Borders, tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military & our Vets .  He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement !
Congresswoman Martha Roby of Alabama has been a consistent and reliable vote for our Make America Great Again Agenda .  She is in a Republican Primary run-off against a recent Nancy Pelosi voting Democrat .  I fully endorse Martha for Alabama 2nd Congressional District !
Governor Henry McMaster is a truly fine man who loves the People of South Carolina .  He was one of my very early supporters and truly helped me to a Big South Carolina Victory .  I will see you all in S . C on Monday and Vice President Pence will be there for Henry on Saturday !
Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November .  Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem .  We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave !
Elect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest, fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world .  Right now we have the dumbest and the worst .  Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing .  Remember their motto, RESIST !  Ours is PRODUCE !
Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate, we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won't give votes for political reasons & because they don't care about Crime coming from Border !  So we need to elect more R's !
Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book, Liars, Leakers and Liberals, the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy, which is fantastic .  Go get it !
You cannot pass legislation on immigration whether it be for safety and security or any other reason including heart, without getting Dem votes .  Problem is, they don't care about security and R's do .  Zero Dems voted to support the Goodlatte Bill .  They won't vote for anything !
We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of – and if we show any weakness, millions of people will journey into our country .
I REALLY DON'T CARE, DO U ?  written on the back of Melania's jacket, refers to the Fake News Media .  Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares !
Big Supreme Court win on internet sales tax - about time !  Big victory for fairness and for our country .  Great victory for consumers and retailers .
Farm Bill just passed in the House .  So happy to see work requirements included .  Big win for the farmers !
I was thrilled to be back in Minnesota for a roundtable with hardworking American Patriots .  Thank you !
The real big story that affects everybody in America is the success of @POTUS's TAX CUT package and what it's done for our economy …  @Varneyco
My Administration is acting swiftly to address the illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border .  Loopholes in our immigration laws all supported by extremist open border Democrats … and that's what they are - they're extremist open border Democrats …
Democrats want open Borders, where anyone can come into our Country, and stay .  This is Nancy Pelosi's dream .  It won't happen !
Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina .  The state is BOOMING, with jobs and new industry setting records .  He is tough on Crime and Strong on Borders, Healthcare, the Military and our great Vets .  Henry has my full and complete Endrosement !  #MAGA
What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate, and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms) .  Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule-it is killing you !
Last night in Minnesota was incredible .  What a crowd !
Henry McMaster has done a great job as Governor of South Carolina .  The State is BOOMING, with jobs and new industry setting records .  He is tough on Crime and strong on Borders, Health Care, the Mititary and our great Vets .  Henry has my full and complete Endorsement !  #MAGA
I will be going the Columbia, South Carolina, on Monday night to do a campaign speech for one of my very early supporters, a man who truly loves the people of South Carolina, Governor Henry McMaster .  Henry worked so hard & was so loyal to me that I look forward to reciprocating !
The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years .  At some point Schumer and Pelosi, who are weak on Crime and Border security, will be forced to do a real deal, so easy, that solves this long time problem .  Schumer used to want Border security - now he'll take Crime !
We shouldn't be hiring judges by the thousands, as our ridiculous immigration laws demand, we should be changing our laws, building the Wall, hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password .
ALL-TIME RECORD OPTIMISM !
Just returning from the Great State of Minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9,000 people, and at least 10,000 who could not get in - I will return !  Congratulations to @PeteStauber who is loved and respected in Minnesota !
Thank you Duluth, Minnesota .  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
So sorry, people wanting to get into the already packed arena - I LOVE YOU ALL !
Just landed in Duluth, Minnesota .  Two events planned - looking forward to them and being with @PeteStauber and his wonderful family !
Don't worry, the Republicans, and your President, will fix it !
Look what Fake ABC News put out .  I guess they had it prepared from the 13 Angry Democrats leading the Witch Hunt !  #StopTheBias
Had a great meeting with the House GOP last night at the Capitol .  They applauded and laughed loudly when I mentioned my experience with Mark Sanford .  I have never been a fan of his !

More records !  #MAGA
FBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias .  @FoxNews  Big News, but the Fake News doesn't want to cover .  Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam !  At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly, too big a story !
It's the Democrats fault, they won't give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation .  They want open borders, which breeds horrible crime .  Republicans want security .  But I am working on something - it never ends !
The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration .  Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world, and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime !
THANK YOU @HouseGOP !
Earlier today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia of Spain to the @WhiteHouse ! 🇺🇸🇪🇸
Homeland Security @SecNielsen did a fabulous job yesterday at the press conference explaining security at the border and for our country, while at the same time recommending changes to obsolete & nasty laws, which force family separation .  We want heart and security in America !
I want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the Southern Border … it has been going on for many, many decades …
THANK YOU @NFIB !  #NFIB75
Join me tomorrow in Duluth, Minnesota for a #MAGA Rally !  Tickets :
#CHANGETHELAWS   Now is the best opportunity ever for Congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration .  Get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security .
We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally .  Of the 12,000 children, 10,000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip, and only 2000 are with their parents, many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions .
Democrats are the problem .  They don't care about crime and want illegal immigrants, no matter how bad they may be, to pour into and infest our Country, like MS-13 .  They can't win on their terrible policies, so they view them as potential voters !
If you don't have Borders, you don't have a Country !
Crime in Germany is up 10% plus (officials do not want to report these crimes) since migrants were accepted .  Others countries are even worse .  Be smart America !
I can't think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election !  Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election .  A Rigged Witch Hunt ! p
Comey gave Strozk his marching orders .  Mueller is Comey's best friend .  Witch Hunt !
If President Obama (who got nowhere with North Korea and would have had to go to war with many millions of people being killed) had gotten along with North Korea and made the initial steps toward a deal that I have, the Fake News would have named him a national hero !
It is the Democrats fault for being weak and ineffective with Boarder Security and Crime .  Tell them to start thinking about the people devastated by Crime coming from illegal immigration .  Change the laws !
CHANGE THE LAWS !
Children are being used by some of the worst criminals on earth as a means to enter our country .  Has anyone been looking at the Crime taking place south of the border .  It is historic, with some countries the most dangerous places in the world .  Not going to happen in the  US
We don't want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us !
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition .  Crime in Germany is way up .  Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture !
Why don't the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world's worst immigration laws ?  Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs, including MS-13, coming into our country illegally ?
The highest level of bias I've ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer .  Trey Gowdy on the FBI's own, Peter Strzok .  Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller .  A really sick deal, isn't it ?
The Democrats should get together with their Republican counterparts and work something out on Border Security & Safety .  Don't wait until after the election because you are going to lose !
Why was the FBI's sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that we'll stop Trump from becoming President ?  Witch Hunt !
Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media .  They are not supposed to be doing that, and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News, they put their own spin on it - truth doesn't matter to them !
WITCH HUNT !  There was no Russian Collusion .  Oh, I see, there was no Russian Collusion, so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion .  The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax .  Too bad they didn't look at Crooked Hillary like this .  Double Standard !
Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn't paying them enough .  I think a really long strike would be a great idea .  Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time !  Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist ?
Our economy is perhaps BETTER than it has ever been .  Companies doing really well, and moving back to America, and jobs numbers are the best in 44 years .
The denuclearization deal with North Korea is being praised and celebrated all over Asia .  They are so happy !  Over here, in our country, some people would rather see this historic deal fail than give Trump a win, even if it does save potentially millions & millions of lives !
Holding back the war games during the negotiations was my request because they are VERY EXPENSIVE and set a bad light during a good faith negotiation .  Also, quite provocative .  Can start up immediately if talks break down, which I hope will not happen !
Funny how the Fake News, in a coordinated effort with each other, likes to say I gave sooo much to North Korea because I met .  That's because that's all they have to disparage !  We got so much for peace in the world, & more is being added in finals .  Even got our hostages/remains !
Daniel Henninger of The Wall Street Journal :  This IG Report makes it clear, as did Rod Rosenstein's memo, that Trump was absolutely justified, unquestionably justified, in firing Jim Comey .  So I think the Mueller Investigation is on pretty weak grounds right now .   Witch Hunt !
Please clear up the Fake News !
Chuck Schumer said the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat .  Thank you Chuck, but are you sure you got that right ?  No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place, blew up launch sites .  Hostages already back, hero remains coming home & much more !
The IG Report totally destroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people .  It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History !
The IG Report totally distroys James Comey and all of his minions including the great lovers, Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, who started the disgraceful Witch Hunt against so many innocent people .  It will go down as a dark and dangerous period in American History !
My supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hard working and most loyal that we have seen in our countries history .  It is a beautiful thing to watch as we win elections and gather support from all over the country .  As we get stronger, so does our country .  Best numbers ever !
Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation, for a change !  This is why we need more Republicans elected in November .  Democrats are good at only three things, High Taxes, High Crime and Obstruction .  Sad !
Great discussions with European Union Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and EU Council President Donald Tusk at the #G7Summit in Canada last week .
The Fake News Media said that I did not get along with other Leaders at the #G7Summit in Canada .  They are once again, WRONG !
I have a great relationship with Angela Merkel of Germany, but the Fake News Media only shows the bad photos (implying anger) of negotiating an agreement - where I am asking for things that no other American President would ask for !
I've had to beat 17 very talented people including the Bush Dynasty, then I had to beat the Clinton Dynasty, and now I have to beat a phony Witch Hunt and all of the dishonest people covered in the IG Report … and never forget the Fake News Media .  It never ends !
Wow, what a tough sentence for Paul Manafort, who has represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole and many other top political people and campaigns .  Didn't know Manafort was the head of the Mob .  What about Comey and Crooked Hillary and all of the others ?  Very unfair !
The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda .  Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall, end Catch & Release, Visa Lottery and Chain, and go to Merit Based Immigration .  Go for it !  WIN !
Donald Trump was 100% right to fire James Comey .  Mark Levin
Why in the world didn't Barack Obama fire this guy (Comey) ?  asks Mark Levin !
Wow, the highest rated (by far) morning show, @foxandfriends, is on the Front Lawn of the White House .  Maybe I'll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them ?
USA  Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years .  If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election, they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy, and jobs, would have been a disaster !
Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the  USA , Mexico and Canada .  I worked hard on this, along with a Great Team of talented people .  We never fail, and it will be a great World Cup !  A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice .
The IG Report is a total disaster for Comey, his minions and sadly, the FBI .  Comey will now officially go down as the worst leader, by far, in the history of the FBI .  I did a great service to the people in firing him .  Good Instincts .  Christopher Wray will bring it proudly back !
FBI Agent Peter Strzok, who headed the Clinton & Russia investigations, texted to his lover Lisa Page, in the IG Report, that we'll stop candidate Trump from becoming President .  Doesn't get any lower than that !
Happy #FlagDay🇺🇸
Happy 243rd Birthday to the @USArmy !  Thank you for your bravery, sacrifices, and dedication to the  USA  We love you !
… Schneiderman, who ran the Clinton campaign in New York, never had the guts to bring this ridiculous case, which lingered in their office for almost 2 years .  Now he resigned his office in disgrace, and his disciples brought it when we would not settle .
The sleazy New York Democrats, and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A . G .  Eric Schneiderman, are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18,800,000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in, $19,200,000 .  I won't settle this case !  …
So, the Democrats make up a phony crime, Collusion with the Russians, pay a fortune to make the crime sound real, illegally leak (Comey) classified information so that a Special Councel will be appointed, and then Collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in Fake News !
Now that I am back from Singapore, where we had a great result with respect to North Korea, the thought process must sadly go back to the Witch Hunt, always remembering that there was No Collusion and No Obstruction of the fabricated No Crime .
The Republican Party is starting to show very big numbers .  People are starting to see what is being done .  Results are speaking loudly .  North Korea and our greatest ever economy are leading the way !
Congratulations to @KevinCramer on his huge win in North Dakota .  We need Kevin in the Senate, and I strongly endorse him .  Heidi voted NO on our Tax Cuts, and always will vote no when we need her .  Kevin is strong on Crime & Borders, big on Cutting Taxes !
Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada .  Danny worked hard an got a great result .  Looking good in November !
Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state .  RV's are not for her .  People are really upset, so phony !  Josh Hawley should win big, and has my full endorsement .
So funny to watch the Fake News, especially NBC and CNN .  They are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea .  500 days ago they would have begged for this deal-looked like war would break out .  Our Country's biggest enemy is the Fake News so easily promulgated by fools !
Oil prices are too high, OPEC is at it again .  Not good !
The  US , together with Mexico and Canada, just got the World Cup .  Congratulations - a great deal of hard work !
We save a fortune by not doing war games, as long as we are negotiating in good faith - which both sides are !
Before taking office people were assuming that we were going to War with North Korea .  President Obama said that North Korea was our biggest and most dangerous problem .  No longer - sleep well tonight !
Just landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day I took office .  There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea .  Meeting with Kim Jong Un was an interesting and very positive experience .  North Korea has great potential for the future !
Congratulations to Corey Stewart for his great victory for Senator from Virginia .  Now he runs against a total stiff, Tim Kaine, who is weak on crime and borders, and wants to raise your taxes through the roof .  Don't underestimate Corey, a major chance of winning !
… realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country .  Wake up Punchy !
Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received too many shots to the head by real boxers in movies .  I watched him last night and truly believe he may be punch-drunk .  I guess he doesn't …
My political representatives didn't want me to get involved in the Mark Sanford primary thinking that Sanford would easily win - but with a few hours left I felt that Katie was such a good candidate, and Sanford was so bad, I had to give it a shot .  Congrats to Katie Arrington !
A year ago the pundits & talking heads, people that couldn't do the job before, were begging for conciliation and peace - please meet, don't go to war .  Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un, the same haters shout out, you shouldn't meet, do not meet !
The World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe !  No more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research !  The hostages are back home with their families .  Thank you to Chairman Kim, our day together was historic !
I want to thank Chairman Kim for taking the first bold step toward a bright new future for his people .  Our unprecedented meeting – the first between an American President and a leader of North Korea – proves that real change is possible !
There is no limit to what NoKo can achieve when it gives up its nuclear weapons and embraces commerce & engagement w/ the world .  Chairman Kim has before him the opportunity to be remembered as the leader who ushered in a glorious new era of security & prosperity for his citizens !
It's time for another #MAGA rally .  Join me in Duluth, Minnesota on Wednesday, June 20th at 6 : 30pm !

Here is the video, A Story of Opportunity that I shared with Kim Jong-un at the #SingaporeSummit

… realize the economy is the best it's ever been with employment being at an all time high, and many companies pouring back into our country .  Wake up Punchy !
Robert De Niro, a very Low IQ individual, has received to many shots to the head by real boxers in movies .  I watched him last night and truly believe he may be punch-drunk .  I guess he doesn't …
… Got along great with Kim Jong-un who wants to see wonderful things for his country .  As I said earlier today :  Anyone can make war, but only the most courageous can make peace !  #SingaporeSummit
Heading back home from Singapore after a truly amazing visit .  Great progress was made on the denuclearization of North Korea .  Hostages are back home, will be getting the remains of our great heroes back to their families, no missiles shot, no research happening, sites closing …
Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA .  He is MIA and nothing but trouble .  He is better off in Argentina .  I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC, a state I love .  She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes .  VOTE Katie !
I strongly endorse Adam Laxalt for Governor of Nevada .  Adam is smart, works hard, and knows how to win .  He will be a great Governor .  Also, will fight hard to lower your taxes and is tough on crime !

Our Great Larry Kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack .  He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center .
Just won big Supreme Court decision on Voting !  Great News !
The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the  US , say the haters & losers .  We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say !  We will be fine !
Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election, with 7 Trillion Dollars of  US  value built throughout the economy .  Lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest in History, and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years .  Highest confidence ever !
Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly … but in the end, that doesn't matter .  We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen !
Thank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong !
Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore .  We must put the American worker first !
Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air !
… Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP .  Does anybody believe that makes sense ?  We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade .  Change is coming !
… And add to that the fact that the  US  pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh ! ) .  The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military !
Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay ?  Not fair to the PEOPLE of America !  $800 Billion Trade Deficit …
Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal .  According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with  US  (guess they were bragging and got caught ! ) .  Minimum is 17B .  Tax Dairy from us at 270% .  Then Justin acts hurt when called out !
PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, US Tariffs were kind of insulting and he will not be pushed around .  Very dishonest & weak .  Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy !
Based on Justin's false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our  US  farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our  US  Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the  US  Market !
…Create peace and great prosperity for his land .  I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted !
I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World .  It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before …
The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies .  While sending their product into our country tax free .  We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough .
…  USA  Trade .  They fully understand where I am coming from .  After many decades, fair and reciprocal Trade will happen !
Just left the @G7 Summit in beautiful Canada .  Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I cannot allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to …
Just met the new Prime Minister of Italy, @GiuseppeConteIT, a really great guy .  He will be honored in Washington, at the @WhiteHouse, shortly .  He will do a great job - the people of Italy got it right !
Henry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning .  He is strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets .  He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy .  Vote on Tuesday !
@G7 Press Briefing in Charlevoix, Canada, prior to departing for Singapore !
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia .  They are truly all HEROES .
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somolia .  They are truly all HEROES .
I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States .  From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization .  Won't be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while !
Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship .  Alex Ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true Superstar !   DC  is popping, in many ways .  What a time !
Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries .  If it doesn't happen, we come out even better !
Canada charges the  US  a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products !  They didn't tell you that, did they ?  Not fair to our farmers !
Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up .  Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we don't need his advice !
Why isn't the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the  US  Totally unfair to our farmers, workers & companies .  Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you !
Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the  US  and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things … but he doesn't bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture !
Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the  US  massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers .  The EU trade surplus with the  US  is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out .  Look forward to seeing them tomorrow .
Great day of meetings with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan !
PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the  US  and Japan, something we have to do .  The  US  seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity .  We're working hard to reduce our trade imbalance …
Today, I am greatly honored to welcome my good friend, PM Abe of Japan to the @WhiteHouse .  Over the past 16 months the Prime Minister and I have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many …
It's my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @AbeShinzo back to the @WhiteHouse ! 🇺🇸🇯🇵
$3 billion payoff :  101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts
Total jobless claims running at lowest level in 44 years
Total jobless claims running at lowest level in 44 years
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States .  This is totally illegal .  Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this matter (as Comey would call it) .  Investigate !
When will people start saying, thank you, Mr .  President, for firing James Comey ?
Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook .  The Democrat I . T .  scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today .  They want to make a plea deal to hide what is on their Server .  Where is Server ?  Really bad !
Looking forward to seeing my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan at noon .  Will be discussing North Korea and Trade .
How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn't have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again ?  Let's face it, he's a Flake !
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax .  There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted .  It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election .  Where is the server ?
Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor :  It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel … All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept .  Don't need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone's back .  Not the way Justice should operate .  So true !

Good luck to Alice Johnson .  Have a wonderful life !
Isn't it Ironic ?  Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea & the Nuclear Problem … But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt !
Thank you to everyone at @FEMA HQ for today's briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season .  Disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it's federally supported, state managed, and locally executed – this is the successful model we will continue to build .
We must always protect those who protect us .  Today, it was my great honor to sign the #VAMissionAct and to make Veterans Choice the permanent law of the land !
Today we mark another milestone :  the 74th anniversary of #DDay, the Allied invasion of Normandy .  On June 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young Americans charged out of landing craft, jumped out of airplanes, and stormed into hell …
Congratulations to Dana Rohrabacher on his big California win .  We are proud of you Dana !
Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible .  The political pundits just don't get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts !  Remember, Dems are High Tax, High Crime, easy to beat !
… Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting .  They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever .  Fake News is really bad !
The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania .  During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W . H .  (and me) for N . Y .  or Virginia, to abuse .  All Fake, she is doing really well !
Gold Star father, Ceejay Metcalf, whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends .  He is a special man !
Great night for Republicans !  Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California .  He can win .  Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible .  So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave .  Working hard !
Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate's August Recess .  Great, maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes .  We need Border Security !
… The greatest Witch Hunt in political history !
… This is a level of criminality beyond the pale .  This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it's like nothing else we've seen in our history .  This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch .  They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the  US  These are all violations of law .  This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election .  There's nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system …
Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign .  SPYGATE at the highest level .  Who would believe ?
Wow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015 .  SPYGATE is in full force !  Is the Mainstream Media interested yet ?  Big stuff !

Imagine how much wasteful spending we'd save if we didn't have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way !  For years, Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end ?  No more .
The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we've proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in Wasteful Spending !  We are getting our government back on track .
Terrific new book out by the wonderful Harris Faulkner, 9 Rules of Engagement .  Harris shares lessons from a military family .  Enjoy !
Senator @RogerWicker of Mississippi has done everything necessary to Make America Great Again !  Get out and vote for Roger, he has my total support !
Vote for Congressman Devin Nunes, a true American Patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world … he truly loves our country and deserves everyone's support !
Get the vote out in California today for Rep .  Kevin McCarthy and all of the great GOP candidates for Congress .  Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi .
In High Tax, High Crime California, be sure to get out and vote for Republican John Cox for Governor .  He will make a BIG difference !
Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats .  Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can't get their act together !  Started the Wall .
… @NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House .  It was a great day for a great sport !
Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big … we will soon see !
The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn't tell me he was going to recuse himself … I would have quickly picked someone else .  So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined … and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion !
We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others .  National Anthem & more great music today at 3 : 00  PM
We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3  PM , The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus .  Honoring America !  NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms !
The  US  has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election .  May be the best economy in the history of our country .  Record Jobs numbers .  Nice !
What is taking so long with the Inspector General's Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey .  Numerous delays .  Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker !  There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know .  Transparency !
The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House .  Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event .  Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling .  Sorry !
Big Supreme Court ruling for Baker just out !
In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job !
The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt .
#500Days of American Greatness :
The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL !  Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong !
Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years .  Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly .  By the time I finish trade talks, that will change .  Big trade barriers against  US  farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken .  Massive trade deficits no longer !
The appointment of the Special Councel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL !  Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong !
The  US  has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN !
China already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans .  Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products .  Not acceptable !
As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong ?  In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms !
This is the best time EVER to look for a job .  James Freeman of WSJ .
… We had Repeal & Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway .  Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month .  Drug prices coming down & Right to Try !
This is my 500th .  Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days .  Massive Tax & Regulation Cuts, Military & Vets, Lower Crime & Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy & Jobs EVER, and much more …
Mark Penn  Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff ?  Why is there an Independent Counsel ?  To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses … Constitution was set up to prevent this … Stormtrooper tactics almost .  A disgrace !

… Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn't have been hired !
As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn't the FBI or Department of Justice have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign ?  Should have told me !
Jesse Watters The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House .   So true !
When you're almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you can't lose a Trade War !  The  US  has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart !
Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the  US  by other countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into  US  coffers ?
The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade .  If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated .  That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade !
There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats) .  When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end ?  So bad for our Country .  Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media ?  Should be looking at Dems corruption instead ?
There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats) .  When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end ?  So bad for our Country .  Is the Special Councel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media ?  Should be looking at Dems corruption instead ?
Real @FoxNews is doing great, Fake News CNN is dead !
Very surprised that China would be doing this ?

Now this is a record that will never be broken !
… $17 million spent, it's a scam Investigation .  Americans are being worked .  We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats .  The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $'s to Crooked H) .  Dan Bongino
John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar .  Not only is he a liar, he's a liar about being a liar .   Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends
John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the Intelligence community than this liar .  He's a liar about being a liar .
We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are .   Neil Irwin of the @nytimes .
Today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard !
Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time .  Highly restrictive on Trade !  They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers !  They report a really high surplus on trade with us .  Do Timber & Lumber in  US  ?
Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8 : 30 this morning .
Why aren't they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show ?  A total double standard but that's O . K . , we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come !
A . P .  has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast .  No Collusion, except by the Democrats !
FAIR TRADE !
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D'Souza today .  He was treated very unfairly by our government !
Very good meetings with North Korea .
Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia !  The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true !
The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign !  Surveillance much ?
Iger, where is my call of apology ?  You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response .  How is Brian Ross doing ?  He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology .  Double Standard !
RUSH LIMBAUGH  If the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren't targeting Trump, they should have told Trump .  If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it ?  Why not tell Trump ?  Because they were pushing this scam .
The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States .  JOE DIGENOVA, former  US  Attorney .
The soon to be released book, The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump, written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit .  The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see !  Out in 5 weeks .
Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November … and his opponent will not .  Remember Alabama .  We can't take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat !
There is no one better to represent the people of N . Y .  and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again .  Dan has my full endorsement !
Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing .
Moments ago, it was my great honor to sign #RightToTry into law !
With the #RightToTry Law I signed today, patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions .  These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise …
Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the #RightToTry Legislation into law .
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ABC does not tolerate comments like those made by Roseanne Barr .  Gee, he never called President Donald J .  Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC .  Maybe I just didn't get the call ?
The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at 1000 people, when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin' .  This is the way they demean and disparage .  They are very dishonest people who don't get me, and never did !
… There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else !  And I wish I did !
… chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way I'm not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too … and that's how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn't you tell me before I picked you …
Rep . Trey Gowdy, I don't think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward .  If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country's …
The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics .  No matter how well WE do, they find fault .  But the forgotten men & women WON, I'm President !
Sorry, I've got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc .
Why aren't the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton .  It's a Rigged Witch Hunt, that's why !  Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration !
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough ! ) are taking the lead in Polls .  There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats !
This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about .  It wasn't just a wiretap against a campaign aide … it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign … people call that Spying … this is unprecedented and  scandalous .  Mollie Hemingway
We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea .  Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more .  Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York .  Solid response to my letter, thank you !
Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama's term showing children from the Border in steel cages .  They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires .  Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country … Bipartisan Bill !
California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others .  On June 5th . , vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man .  He'll Make California Great Again !
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance) .  This is too good to be true for Republicans … Remember, the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime, the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members … not good !
Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny .  They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served .  They cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families .  They inspired their communities …
The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life .  They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty …
Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance .  We are gathered here on the sacred soil of @ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom .  #MemorialDay
We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation .  That raises legitimate questions .  I just find this really odd … this goes to the heart of our electoral system .  Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept .  I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable .  Jonathan Turley
The President deserves some answers .  @FoxNews in discussing SPYGATE .
Happy Memorial Day !  Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today .  Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more .  Nice !
#MemorialDay🇺🇸
Why didn't President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election ?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn't want to upset the apple cart !  He was in charge, not me, and did nothing .
Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself .  I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day .  Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this .  It will happen !
Why didn't the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia ?  Why didn't the FBI take the Server from the DNC ?   Rigged Investigation !
Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in  DC  showing their patriotism .  They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem !  Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller .
Who's going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt ?  They journeyed down to Washington,  DC , with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation … They went back home in tatters !
WELCOME HOME JOSH !
When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest ?  It's been a long time now !  Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia ?
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged .  Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven't been lost in decades .  13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years .  #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST !
With Spies, or Informants as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it's not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn't the crooked highest levels of the FBI or Justice contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem ?
The Failing @nytimes quotes a senior White House official, who doesn't exist, as saying even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed .  WRONG AGAIN !  Use real people, not phony sources .
Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Korea … and if there was, it wouldn't matter .  The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning !
Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives .  His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world !
Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House .  The great people of Utah are Celebrating !
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the  US  Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL !  DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS .
Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela .  Should be landing in  DC  this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7 : 00  PM  The great people of Utah will be very happy !
We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th . , and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date .
… but complain and obstruct .  They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world !
Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks .  I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase  US  parts and pay a $1 . 3 Billion fine .  Dems do nothing …
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don't even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States .  Lost almost $800 Billion/year under O
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won't let them do their job .  The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast … the killings must stop !
To the @NavalAcademy Class of 2018, I say :  We know you are up to the task .  We know you will make us proud .  We know that glory will be yours .  Because you are WINNERS, you are WARRIORS, you are FIGHTERS, you are CHAMPIONS, and YOU will lead us to VICTORY !  God Bless the  USA  !
On behalf of the American People, CONGRATULATIONS !  We love you !
Today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States @NavalAcademy in Annapolis, Maryland .  Congratulations ! 

Good luck .  Godspeed .  And ANCHORS AWEIGH !
Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea .  We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace .  Only time (and talent) will tell !
Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea .  Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead .  Dems have lost touch !
Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy … Widespread Spying involving multiple people .  Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story !
Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain ?  And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST !
The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party's campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be .  But what about an Informant who is paid a fortune and who sets up way earlier than the Russian Hoax ?
I will be making the Commencment Address today at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland .  Look forward to being with some of the greatest people on earth !
Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse .  Full ceremony :
Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act .  Read more :
I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th .  While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world …
It was my great honor to host a roundtable re :  MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York .  Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives !
Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un .
Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jung Un .
Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI .  Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI !  #SPYGATE
Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign .  Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal .  Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in  US  history .  SPYGATE - a terrible thing !
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6 : 00  AM  Enjoy !
Great to be in New York for the day .  Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now, lots of work to be done !
Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York .  Keep up the great work !
Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release .  Democrats must abandon their resistance …
Today on Long Island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS-13 .  I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union …
Thank you @SBAList !  #SBAGala
WITCH HUNT !
There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers .  After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough !
Big legislation will be signed by me shortly .  After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK .
Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion .
Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign No, James Clapper, I am not happy .  Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot !
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman !  @foxandfriends
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history !
It's clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign Judge Andrew Napolitano
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State .  They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before !  What goes around, comes around !
@foxandfriends  New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal .  Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign ?  Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities !
… Follow the money !  The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion .  He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped !
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn't a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal …
For the first time since Roe v .  Wade, America has a Pro-Life President, a Pro-Life Vice President, a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals !
It was my honor to welcome @NASCAR Cup Series Champion @MartinTruex_Jr and his team to the @WhiteHouse yesterday !
Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the @WhiteHouse ! 🇺🇸🇰🇷
@AsaHutchinson, the great Governor of Arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow .  He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention .  Asa loves our military and our veterans .  I fully endorse Asa for Governor !
Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce .
The Wall Street Journal asks, WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA ?   A very good question !
… they then used to start an investigation about Trump .  It is that simple .  This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle .  This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation .  Brennan has disgraced himself, he's worried about staying out of Jail .  Dan Bongino
… top of the FBI .  Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump .  We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier … he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which …
John Brennan is panicking .  He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community .  He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American's faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the …
China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made .  The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in .  I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing !
On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time .
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years !
I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn't President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc .  ?  They did NOTHING !  With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue !  Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen !
I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration !
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they're looking at the rest of the World .  Oh' great !
… and why hasn't the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm ?  Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington,  DC  ?
What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI ?  They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server ?
Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party .  Don't worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier !
… in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more .  Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam .
… At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP !  They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren't looking at the corruption …
Things are really getting ridiculous .  The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World's most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World !
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal .  Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers .  Drain the Swamp !
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House .  Melania is feeling and doing really well .  Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes !
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House .  Melanie is feeling and doing really well .  Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes !
Happy #ArmedForcesDay to our GREAT military men and women for their selfless service to our Nation !
America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal .  We have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance !
California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes .  John Cox is the man - he'll be the best Governor you've ever had .  I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again !
Just met with UN Secretary-General António Guterres who is working hard to Make the United Nations Great Again .  When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the  US  has less to do and we save money .  @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job !
America is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption .  America is a Nation that believes in second chances - and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come !  #PrisonReform
We grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas .  To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School – we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever …
School shooting in Texas .  Early reports not looking good .  God bless all !
Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president .  It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a hot Fake News story .  If true - all time biggest political scandal !
Why isn't disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe's wife in her run for office ?  Then dropped case on Clinton !
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, Animals .  Wrong !  They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories .  I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as Animals, a big difference - and so true .  Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual !
Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign .  This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn't commit .   David Asman  @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett   Really bad stuff !
It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center .  There is nobody like them !
Tomorrow, the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill, which includes work requirements .  We must support our Nation's great farmers !
Great talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week .  He is doing such a good job for Argentina .  I support his vision for transforming his country's economy and unleashing its potential !
Talking trade with the Vice Premier of the People's Republic of China, Liu He .
Congratulations to our new CIA Director, Gina Haspel !
Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday .  Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care .  Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE – Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day !
Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in  US  history - by far !  Sorry to the Fake News Media and Haters, but that's the way it is !
Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT .  Andrew McCarthy says, There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign .  If so, this is bigger than Watergate !
Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN IMBEDDED INFORMANT .  Andrew McCarthy says, There's probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign .  If so, this is bigger than Watergate !
Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History … and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction .  The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money !
Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA .  She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately .  We need her to keep our great country safe !  #ConfirmGina
… and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill .  He's also weak on borders and crime .  Sadly, our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr .  Lou Barletta will win !  #MAGA
Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time .  He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare …
Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the @WhiteHouse !
House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act .  Who will stand with our Great Vets, caregivers, and Veterans Service Organizations ?  Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day !
… haven't even started yet !  The  US  has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years .  China has much to give !
… We have not seen China's demands yet, which should be few in that previous  US  Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating .  China has seen our demands .  There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings …
The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China .  Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal .  Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China …
Congratulations to Deb Fischer .  The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box !  #MAGA
Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania .  He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven't been represented in many years .  Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Thank you to the Washington Examiner and @CortesSteve on the great article - on WINNING !
#PeaceOfficersMemorialDay
Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty .  They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace .  We stand with our police (HEROES) 100% !
Nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today !
Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the  $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year .  Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it !
Trade negotiations are continuing with China .  They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the  US , for many years .  Stay tuned !
Our great First Lady is doing really well .  Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days .  Thank you for so much love and support !
Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania .  Successful procedure, she is in good spirits .  Thank you to all of the well-wishers !
The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible .  With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are !
ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from  US  companies .  This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi .
#USEmbassyJerusalem
Big day for Israel .  Congratulations !
US  Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews & @FoxBusiness .  Lead up to 9 : 00  AM  (eastern) event has already begun .  A great day for Israel !
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris .  At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on .  This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, & successful country !  Changes to our thought process on terror must be made .
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place .  They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary .  Now, that will not happen !
China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries .  But be cool, it will all work out !
President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast .  Too many jobs in China lost .  Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done !
Happy Mother's Day !  !  !
The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME .  Wall and Border Security should be included .  Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history .  Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do .  STAY !
Iran's Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached … just another indicator that it was all a big lie .  But not anymore !
North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th .  Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture !
Why doesn't the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration's Anti-Trust Division has been, and is, opposed to the AT&T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial .  Such a disgrace in reporting !
Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem .  Congratulations to all !
The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them .  We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve .  We will not rest until the job is done !
Today, my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People .  We will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter !
Thank you Indiana !  #MAGA🇺🇸
The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th .  We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace !
Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured !
Senator Cryin' Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it !  Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn't really believe that !  Same with Comey .  Thought he was terrible until I fired him !
On behalf of the American people, WELCOME HOME !
Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today .  There is nobody even close to run the CIA !
Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2 : 00  AM
The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea .  Fake News, so bad !
Secretary Pompeo and his guests will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2 : 00  AM  in the morning .  I will be there to greet them .  Very exciting !
I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting .  They seem to be in good health .  Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un .  Date & Place set .
Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio .  He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs .   His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job !
Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country .  She represents an ever expanding group of very smart thinkers, and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on … so good for our Country !
The Fake News is working overtime .  Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake) .  Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt ?  Take away credentials ?
The Republican Party had a great night .  Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November .  The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldn't we win ?
The Iran Deal is defective at its core .  If we do nothing, we know what will happen .  In just a short time, the world's leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world's most dangerous weapons …
Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal :
John Kerry can't get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it !  Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country !
I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8 : 30 .  The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building .
Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR !  This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone .  The CIA wants her to lead them into America's  bright and glorious future !
I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2 : 00pm .
National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in !  Another record broken :  nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed !  Let's keep fighting this opioid epidemic, America !
The United States does not need John Kerry's possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal .   He was the one that created this MESS in the first place !
Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended ?  Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late !
Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught ?  Why is Peter S still there ?  What a total mess .  Our Country has to get back to Business !
Good luck to Ric Grenell, our new Ambassador to Germany .  A great and talented guy, he will represent our Country well !
The Great Revolt by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory .  The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer !
The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice … and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest !
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility .  House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia .  So now the Probe says OK, what else is there ?  How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime . There is no O, it's called Fighting Back
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists .  Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror .  Win Gina !
To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference .  Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can't win the General Election in your State … No way !  Remember Alabama .  Vote Rep .  Jenkins or A . G .  Morrisey !
Thank you Cleveland, Ohio !
Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives .  We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with  US  trade wins !
Just returned home to the beautiful White House, from Dallas, where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA .  It was so wonderful to be there !
Great book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder .  Always known as somebody who knows how to win, Capitalist Comeback will be a big hit !
I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA .  We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment !  God Bless you, and God Bless America !
We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR .  Illegal immigration must end !
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets .  Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office !
All of us here today are united by the same timeless values .  We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away .  We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement .  We have pride in our history …
JUST OUT :  3 . 9% Unemployment .  4% is Broken !  In the meantime, WITCH HUNT !
Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today .  Leaving soon !
NBC NEWS is wrong again !  They cite sources which are constantly wrong .  Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don't exist, they are fabricated, fiction !  NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN .  Sad !
Andy McCarthy will be on  @LouDobbs tonight .  7 : 00  PM  , @FoxBusiness .
Because Jobs in the  US  are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973 .  Great !
Our Southern Border is under siege .  Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws .  Must build a Wall .  Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help !
#NationalDayOfPrayer
This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis .  We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS .  Choice is vital, but the program needs work & is running out of $ .  Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve .  I will sign immediately !
Today, it was my great honor to celebrate the #NationalDayOfPrayer at the @WhiteHouse, in the Rose Garden !  Proclamation :
… despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair .  Prior to its violation by Ms .  Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement .  Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction .

Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade !  I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future .  We will always have a good (great) relationship !
Ainsley Earnhardt, a truly great person, just wrote a wonderful book, The Light Within Me, which is doing really well .  She is very special and so is her new book … bring it to number one !
As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail .  Stay tuned !
This isn't some game .  You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States .   John Dowd, March 2018 .   With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian Collusion .
I have been briefed on the  US  C-130 Hercules cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport .  Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard .
Congratulations @SecPompeo !
A Rigged System - They don't want to turn over Documents to Congress .  What are they afraid of ?  Why so much redacting ?  Why such unequal justice ?  At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved !
NEW BOOK - A MUST READ !  The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett .  A sad chapter for law enforcement .  A rigged system !
The questions are an intrusion into the President's Article 2  powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee … what the President was thinking is an outrageous … as to the President's unfettered power to fire anyone …  Joe Digenova, former US Attorney
There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap) .  What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more .  Witch Hunt !
Today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse !
Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football !
Today I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse .  Congratulations !
Yesterday, it was my great honor to welcome President @MBuhari of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the @WhiteHouse ! 🇺🇸🇳🇬
It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened !  Witch Hunt !
Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country .  Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now .  Same with other countries and NAFTA … but it will all get done .  Great Potential for USA !
So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were leaked to the media .  No questions on Collusion .  Oh, I see … you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information .  Nice !
The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc .  There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done .  We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so !  Fake News is going bonkers !
The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don't exist) .  They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can't believe they are saying .  Truly bad people !
During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business !
The migrant ‘caravan' that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective  US  immigration laws are .  Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities .  We need lawmakers who will put America First .
I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits .  I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts .  #DrainTheSwamp
Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country ?  Just asking !
The White House Correspondents' Dinner is DEAD as we know it .  This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for .  FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night !
Headline :  Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if  US  Pledges Not to Invade - from the Failing New York Times .  Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May .
The White House Correspondents' Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it .  The filthy comedian totally bombed (couldn't even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance) .  Put Dinner to rest, or start over !
Trump's Triumphs are driving his critics Crazy !  Thank you Steve Hilton @NextRevFNC, just want to do what is right for our wonderful  USA
Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time … Well, much more has been accomplished !
While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington,  DC , just didn't work .  Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust … the so-called comedian really bombed .  @greggutfeld should host next year !  @PeteHegseth
Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan .  The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal .  To the many thousands of people who couldn't get in, I cherish you … and will be back !
Join me LIVE in Washington, Michigan at 7 : 00pmE on @FoxNews !  #MAGA
Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester's statements on Admiral Jackson are not true .  There were no such findings .  A horrible thing that we in  DC  must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion .  Tester should lose race in Montana .  Very dishonest and sick !
Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight .  Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State .  Auto companies expanding at record pace .  Big crowd tonight, will be live on T . V .
Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea .  Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set .  Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations .
Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN @foxandfriends FoxNews  He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN .
… great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being .  Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered .  Not fair, Tester !
Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false .  The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family .  Tester should resign .  The …
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia .  As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies .  There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed .  Witch Hunt !

Just Out :  House Intelligence Committee Report released .  No evidence that the Trump Campaign colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia .  Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow !  A total Witch Hunt !  MUST END NOW !
Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today .  So much to discuss, so little time !  It will be good for both of our great countries !
Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff !  Thank you also to Chance and Dr .  Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history) .
Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea .  Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process !
So great to have Staff Sgt .  Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday .  These are truly brave and special people !  @foxandfriends
KOREAN WAR TO END !  The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea !
After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place .  Good things are happening, but only time will tell !
Is everybody believing what is going on .  James Comey can't define what a leak is .  He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn't understand what he did or how serious it is .  He lied all over the place to cover it up .  He's either very sick or very dumb .  Remember sailor !
The  US  has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup .  It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the  US  bid .  Why should we be supporting these countries when they don't support us (including at the United Nations) ?
Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning .  Great show !
I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8 : 00  AM  Enjoy !
MAGA !
Thank you Kanye, very cool !
Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple .  We will be talking about many things, including how the  US  has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade .
@FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte .  Every detail was done to perfection .  The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful, and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did .
Busy day planned .   Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today .  This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done … he will be GREAT !
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat .  Debbie will do a Great Job !  Press is so silent .
Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny .  We are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of God in every human soul .
Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome French President @EmmanuelMacron and Mrs .  Brigitte Macron to the @WhiteHouse .  We look forward to hosting them at tonight's State Dinner, in their honor .
@JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions, Illegal Immigration, the Border and Crime .  I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !  He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio, and has my full endorsement !

President Trump Calls the  US -France Relationship ‘Unbreakable . ' History Shows He's Right .
Arizona, please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08 .  Strong on Border, Immigration and Crime .  Great on the Military .  Time is ticking down - get out and VOTE today .  We need Debbie in Congress !
Americans stand with you and all of Canada, Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau .  Our thoughts and prayers are with you all .  #TorontoStrong
Having great meetings and discussions with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron of France .  We are in the midst of meetings on Iran, Syria and Trade .  We will be holding a joint press conference shortly, here at the @WhiteHouse .  🇺🇸🇫🇷
Here's a great stat - since January 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1 . 9 million .  The American people are finally back to work !
Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the  US  We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement .  Our Country cannot accept what is happening !  Also, we must get Wall funding fast .
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country .  It is a disgrace .  We are the only Country in the World so naive !  WALL
Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State .  The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany .  They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before .  Need more Republicans !
Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office .  They keep us safe and are very cool about it !
Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel ?  There's no there there .  Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought !
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn't come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal !
A complete Witch Hunt !
I can die happy now with Trump Job performance, stated Mary Matalin .  A great overall President, stunning !  Thank you Mary .
… We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won't - only time will tell … But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago !
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing .  Wow, we haven't given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing !
GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton .  @FoxNews   Good luck with that request !
At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information .   Wall Street Journal
The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as Mr .  Magoo and Rod Rosenstein as Mr .  Peepers .  This is according to people with whom the president has spoken .  There are no such people and don't know these characters … just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will !
James Comey's Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them .  They belong to our Government !  Therefore, he broke the law !  Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker .  Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others ?
Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson .  His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial .  Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon !
So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning .  Now he R's counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails !
Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush .  First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects .  Will be a beautiful day !
Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family .  In memory of First Lady Barbara Bush, there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the Center Hall of the @WhiteHouse .
Fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in Key West, Florida .  Thank you !

A message from Kim Jong Un :  North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles . 
Also will Shut down a nuclear test site in the country's Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests .  Progress being made for all !
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council ?  Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act ?  Really, does everybody know what that means ?
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats .  This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails .
North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site .  This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress !  Look forward to our Summit .
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats .  This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails .
Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day ?  The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press .  Make America Great Again !
Looks like OPEC is at it again .  With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High !  No good and will not be accepted !
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans … got not one Democrat Vote !  Here's a choice .  They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially .  Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts !
So exciting !  I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis, Maryland .  Looking forward to being there .
So General Michael Flynn's life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written) .  Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work ?  I don't think so !
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION .  Also, he leaked classified information .  WOW !  Will the Witch Hunt continue ?
James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe under the bus .  Inspector General's Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them !  Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine ?
Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed .  We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult !
My thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today .
Mike Pompeo is outstanding .  First in his class at West Point .  A top student at Harvard Law School .  A success at whatever he has done .  We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP .  He will be a great Secretary of State !
… Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved .  The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country !
Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People .  They are slow walking all of my nominations - hundreds of people .  At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals !
@MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her .  Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime .  Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee .  She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her !
THANK YOU #JIATFSouth, @Norad_Northcom, @southcomwatch and @DHSgov .  Keep up the GREAT work !
Just arrived @NASKeyWest !  Heading to a briefing with the Joint Interagency Task Force South, NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM .
Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy up to 400 National Guard Troops to do nothing .  The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown's charade .  We need border security and action, not words !
Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies .  California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk .
Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who has just left Florida .  Talked in depth about North Korea, Military and Trade .  Good things will happen !
It was my great honor to host my friend @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days .  Lots accomplished, thank you !  #Success🇺🇸🇯🇵
Great working luncheon with  US  and Japanese Delegations this afternoon !
Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at Trump International Golf Club .
Best wishes to Prime Minister @Netanyahu and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence .  We have no better friends anywhere .  Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month !
Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems) !
Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week .  Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed .  Details of Summit are being worked out now .  Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea !
A sketch years later about a nonexistent man .  A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it) !
There is a Revolution going on in California .  Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept .  Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy .  Want Security & Safety NOW !
While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don't like the deal for the United States .  Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn't work .  Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers .  Look how bad WTO is to  US
Pastor Andrew Brunson, a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States, is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason .  They call him a Spy, but I am more a Spy than he is .  Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs !
It is my great honor to host @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo !

States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers .  Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores !
… Congress – House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society .  Keep America Safe !
Today's Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons .  This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by …
Welcome Prime Minister Abe !
Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media .  They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day .  Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post, and they haven't changed (get new pollsters) .  Much of the media is a Scam !
Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman !
So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill .  Everyone is talking, really nice to see !
Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border .  He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border .  The high crime rate will only get higher .  Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started !
I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan .  Working on Trade and Military Security .
Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN .  Enjoy !
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the  US  keeps raising interest rates .  Not acceptable !
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers .  Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes !
Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point .  With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it's hard to believe !  Thank you America, we are doing Great Things .
Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart ! ), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far !
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past .  I have many (too many ! ) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken .  All lawyers are deflated and concerned !
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty .  I hardly even knew this guy .  Just another of his many lies .  His memos are self serving and FAKE !
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term Mission Accomplished .  I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back .  Use often !
Comey throws AG Lynch under the bus !  Why can't we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch ?  Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary .  No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break) !
The big questions in Comey's badly reviewed book aren't answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn't they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe's $700,000 & more ?
Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe .  In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job .  Slimeball !
So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had .  There won't be anything, or anyone, even close !
A perfectly executed strike last night .  Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military .  Could not have had a better result .  Mission Accomplished !

DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster .  He LIED !  LIED !  LIED !  McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey !  !  No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes !
We are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words :  MADE IN THE USA !
… untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI .  His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst botch jobs of history .  It was my great honor to fire James Comey !
James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR .  Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired .  He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted .  He lied to Congress under OATH .  He is a weak and …
Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities .  Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it .  They will soon be protected !
Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres .  Obama .  We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years !
America's greatest treasure is our people – and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK .  We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity, purpose and pride .  AMERICAN SPIRIT is back !  #TaxCuts
Thank you to all of the American workers who travelled here today !  This event is dedicated to YOU :  the hardworking Americans who make this nation run .  You love your country, you provide for your family, you have PRIDE in your work and you cherish our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG !  #TaxCuts
Just had an Agricultural Roundtable with memembers of Congress and Governors . 

I will be making remarks on the large scale TAX CUTS given to American families and workers at 1 : 45  PM  from the Rose Garden .  Join me live :
I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons ! ) .  I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process .
On Yom HaShoah we remember the six million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust .  With each passing year, our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #NeverAgain .  #HolocaustRemembranceDay
Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today .  He will be a great Secretary of State !
Never said when an attack on Syria would take place .  Could be very soon or not so soon at all !  In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS .  Where is our Thank you America ?
California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border .  Thank you Jerry, good move for the safety of our Country !
If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him .  Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper !
Big show tonight on @seanhannity !  9 : 00  PM  on @FoxNews
Honored to have Republican Congressional Leadership join me at the @WhiteHouse this evening .  Lots to discuss as we continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform
The @WhiteHouse is partnering with @Interior and @NatlParkService to bring the @NSCsafety's Prescribed to Death Opioid Memorial to the Ellipse - beginning tomorrow, April 12th to April 18th .  More information :
Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question .  We are with you Paul !
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama .  Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter) .  No Collusion, so they go crazy !
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War .  There is no reason for this .  Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together .  Stop the arms race ?
Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria .  Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and smart !  You shouldn't be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it !
… doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus .  No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information !  BAD !
So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House .  Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria .  Feels great to have Bolton & Larry K on board .  I (we) are
The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story .  It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine .  I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story !
Today, it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion, Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House .  Congratulations !  #RollTide
Very thankful for President Xi of China's kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers … also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers .  We will make great progress together !

Last night, it was my great honor to host America's senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House .  America's military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world .  They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform !
A TOTAL WITCH HUNT !  !  !
Attorney–client privilege is dead !
Great @Cabinet meeting at the @WhiteHouse this morning !
The Democrats are not doing what's right for our country .  I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law !
When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2% .  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25% .  Does that sound like free or fair trade .   No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years !
Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win !  When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead .  Now he is the Masters Champion !
If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago !  Animal Assad would have been history !
… to pay .  Open area immediately for medical help and verification .  Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever .  SICK !
Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria .  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world .  President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad .  Big price …
President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade .  China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do .  Taxes will become Reciprocal & a deal will be made on Intellectual Property .  Great future for both countries !
The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact .  Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting .  Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don't exist .  Story on John Kelly isn't true, just another hit job !
The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact .  Story after story is made up made garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting .  Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don't exist .  Story on John Kelly isn't true … just another hit job !
The FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation .  They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath …  and much more .  So true Jesse !  @WattersWorld
While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA .  Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars .  Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK .  Scott is doing a great job !
Fire at Trump Tower is out .  Very confined (well built building) .  Firemen (and women) did a great job .  THANK YOU !
What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide ?  Why aren't they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE ?  Stalling, but for what reason ?  Not looking good !
Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more .  Slow walking - what is going on ?  BAD !
We are sealing up our Southern Border .  The people of our great country want Safety and Security .  The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue !
The United States hasn't had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years .  They must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs .  The  US  is losing $500 Billion a year, and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades .  Cannot continue !
Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy .  May God be with them all !
Congratulations to @bernieandsid on their new @77wabcradio morning radio show in New York City .  It was an honor to join you two – good luck !
BET founder :  Trump's economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force
AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS !
Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A . G .  Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege ?  Do people really believe this stuff ?  So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt !
China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization .  They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the  US  Does anybody think this is fair .  We were badly represented .  The WTO is unfair to  US
Despite the Aluminum Tariffs, Aluminum prices are DOWN 4% .  People are surprised, I'm not !  Lots of money coming into  US  coffers and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs !
Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice .  It was my great honor to be with the amazing people of West Virginia today !  #MAGA
Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS, America is open for business, and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses !
The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon's chief lobbyist, has another (of many) phony headlines, Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties .  WRONG !  Should read, Trump Defiant as  US  Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive  I . P .  Theft .  Typically bad reporting !
The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border .  Because of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low .  Stop drugs !
Still Rising :  Rasmussen Poll Shows Donald Trump Approval Ratings Now at 51 Percent
Today we honor Dr .  Martin Luther King, Jr .  on the 50th anniversary of his assassination .  Earlier this year I spoke about Dr .  King's legacy of justice and peace, and his impact on uniting Americans .  #MLK50 Proclamation :
Our thoughts and prayers are with the four  US  Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing who lost their lives in yesterday's Southern California helicopter crash .  We pray for their families, and our great @USMC .
When you're already $500 Billion DOWN, you can't lose !
We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the  US  Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion .  We cannot let this continue !
Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong .  Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW !  The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked … CRIME !  We will be taking strong action today .
Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube's HQ in San Bruno, California .  Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved .  Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene .
WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER !
Today, it was my honor to welcome Estonia President @KerstiKaljulaid, Lithuania President @Grybauskaite_LT, and Latvia President @Vejonis to the @WhiteHouse .  Congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence !  #BalticSummit :
I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy .  Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer .  Many billions of dollars .  P . O .  leaders don't have a clue (or do they ? ) !
Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling .  Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin' Obama at the same time in his Administration .
Check out the fact that you can't get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump ?  Little Jeff Zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately .  They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting !
The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our Weak Laws Border, had better be stopped before it gets there .  Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen .  Congress MUST ACT NOW !
The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast .  The Fakers at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction !
#AutismAwarenessDay #LightItUpBlue
President Trump's approval rate among likely  US  voters hit 50 percent on Monday, which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term, according to a new poll .  Via :  @Anna_Giaritelli @DCExaminer
39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay .  At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working .  Never happened before .  Disgraceful !
Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the  US  is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES .  Caravans are heading here .  Must pass tough laws and build the WALL .  Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime !
As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from .  A whole big wasted procedure must take place .  Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke .  ACT CONGRESS
President Donald J .  Trump Proclaims April 2, 2018, World Autism Awareness Day
An honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll !
So sad that the Department of Justice and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress .  An embarrassment to our country !
Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon .  THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed .  Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country … not a level playing field !
So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased .  Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke .
Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA … They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic .  With all of the money they make from the  US , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws !
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon …  No longer works .  Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation .  Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime !
… Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People .  Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don't allow them to do their job .  Act now Congress, our country is being stolen !
Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large Caravans of people enter their country .  They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws …
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA .  They want in on the act !
Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the  US  They laugh at our dumb immigration laws .  They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA .  NEED WALL !
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release .  Getting more dangerous .  Caravans coming .  Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW .  NO MORE DACA DEAL !
HAPPY EASTER !
Governor Jerry Moonbeam Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs .  Is this really what the great people of California want ?  @FoxNews
… does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a lobbyist and should so  REGISTER .  If the P . O .  increased its parcel rates, Amazon's shipping costs would rise by $2 . 6 Billion .  This Post Office scam must stop .  Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now !
While we are on the subject, it is reported that the  US  Post Office will lose $1 . 50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon .  That amounts to Billions of Dollars .  The Failing N . Y .  Times reports that the size of the company's lobbying staff has ballooned, and that …

Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair .  No more !  It's time to REBUILD, and we will do it with American WORKERS, American GRIT, and American PRIDE !
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !  Unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low .  Together, we are making the economy great again !
We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio .  A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site, where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined !
I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election .  Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the  US ), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business !
… In the interim, Hon .  Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary .  I am thankful for Dr .  David Shulkin's service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS !
I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L .  Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs …
Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL !
… release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State .  All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders .
My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies .  California's Sanctuary laws …
@USTradeRep just announced an agreement in principle with South Korea on KORUS !  A great deal for American and Korean workers .  Let's now focus on our important security relationship .
Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me .  In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost !
For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility .  Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity .  Look forward to our meeting !
THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED !  As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY .  We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court !
I am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the President's Park in April .  I encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic .  We will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis !
Trade talks going on with numerous countries that, for many years, have not treated the United States fairly .  In the end, all will be happy !
Great news !  #MAGA
So much Fake News .  Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate .  But through it all, our country is doing great !
The economy is looking really good .  It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers .  The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better .
@HowieCarrShow just wrote a book which everyone is talking about .  He was a great help .  He is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in NH and beyond .  He calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times .  The book is called, What Really Happened .  Enjoy !  #MAGA
President Donald J .  Trump Proclaims March 25, 2018, as Greek Independence Day :  A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy
Happy National #MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES .  We love you !
… lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team .  Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems !
Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case … don't believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on .  Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted .  Problem is that a new …
Much can be done with the $1 . 6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall .  It is just a down payment .  Work will start immediately .  The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not) !
Because of the $700 & $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich .  Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense .  Build WALL through M !
France honors a great hero .  Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack .  So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism .  Even stronger measures needed, especially at borders !
Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday, and we grieve the nation's loss .  We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support .  We are with you @EmmanuelMacron !
As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill .  I say to Congress :  I will NEVER sign another bill like this again .  To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills !
Obama Administration legalized bump stocks .  BAD IDEA .  As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period .  We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns .
News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill .   1 : 00  PM
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded .
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats .  Very unfair to them !  Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall .
House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report .  FINDINGS :  (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia .  (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient .  (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts .
I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor .  I am very thankful for the service of General H . R .  McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend .  There will be an official contact handover on 4/9 .
My honor Charlie - thank you !  #MAGA
As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security .   Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment .
Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary's large and highly sophisticated staff .  Well, not saying that anymore !
Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy .  Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault .  He doesn't know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way .  Don't threaten people Joe !
Democrats refused to take care of DACA .  Would have been so easy, but they just didn't care .  I had to fight for Military and start of Wall .
Got $1 . 6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming .  Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year … most ever .  Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment .
… They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race .  Bush tried to get along, but didn't have the smarts .  Obama and Clinton tried, but didn't have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET) .  PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH !
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also) .  The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him .  They are wrong !  Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing …
Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not .  I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council .  I am still opposed to it .  I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because …
… there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice !   So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz .
Special Council is told to find crimes, wether crimes exist or not .  I was opposed the the selection of Mueller to be Special Council, I still am opposed to it .  I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because …
Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona .  I agree with @LouDobbs .  Should have sought review .
AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD .  Great job by law enforcement and all concerned !
Our Nation was founded by farmers .  Our independence was won by farmers .  And our continent was tamed by farmers .  Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them, and we are DELIVERING for them !  #NationalAgricultureDay
The Democrats do not want to help DACA .  Would be so easy to make a deal !
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest !
@seanhannity on @foxandfriends now !  Great !  8 : 18  AM
Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans ?  Another Dem recently added … does anyone think this is fair ?  And yet, there is NO COLLUSION !
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me .  I don't believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date .  Same with lying James Comey .  Can we call them Fake Memos ?
Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked have you ever been an anonymous source … or known someone else to be an anonymous source …  ?  He said strongly never, no .  He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends .
The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime .  It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign .  WITCH HUNT !
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired .  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife's campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation ?  How many lies ?  How many leaks ?  Comey knew it all, and much more !
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign .  As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State .  #DrainTheSwamp
Happy #StPatricksDay
Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy .  Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy .  He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI !
US  Consumer Confidence Hits 14-Year High
It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it's unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed !
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday .  Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten .
President Donald J .  Trump Delivers Remarks at the Shamrock☘️Bowl Presentation by Prime Minister Varadkar in the East Room of the White House 🇺🇸🇮🇪
Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU - so tragic .  Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives .  Thank you for your courage .  Praying this evening for all who are affected .
It was my honor to welcome Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland to the @WhiteHouse !
We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive) .   PM  Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn't like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs .  the  US (negotiating), but they do … they almost all do … and that's how I know !
Larry Kudlow will be my Chief Economic Advisor as Director of the National Economic Council .  Our Country will have many years of Great Economic & Financial Success, with low taxes, unparalleled innovation, fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way !  #MAGA
Please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators, their families and our incredible @USNavy .
It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began .  Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening !
Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act .  We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools .  A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again !
Thank you for hosting !  #MAGA
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country !
Five of our incredible @Cabinet Secretaries are testifying on the Hill this morning on the need to rebuild our Nation's crumbling infrastructure .  We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE .  Thank you @SenateCommerce for hosting this hearing !  #InfrastructureInAmerica
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of  US  companies been better than they are today !
Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate .  Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction .  Worst in  US  history !
All across this nation, we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines !  Thank you .  God Bless You .  And God Bless America !
It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our GREAT  US  Military, straight from the heart of the American People :  We support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back !
It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Core Air Station Miramar to our GREAT  US  Military, straight from the heart of the American People :  We support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back !
If we don't have a wall system, we're not going to have a country .  Congress must fund the BORDER WALL & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country .  We must enforce our laws & protect our people !  #BuildTheWall
California's sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk .  Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans .  THIS MUST STOP !
According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime, drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole …
Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California !
Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State .  He will do a fantastic job !  Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service !  Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen .  Congratulations to all !
The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better .  Jobs and wages up .  Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going !
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION .
It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse !  #HoustonStrong
The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress .  He will be much better for steel and business .  Very strong on experience and what our Country needs .  Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems … Will raise taxes, weak on Crime and Border .
If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter .  Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones .  Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent !
… On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting .  States are making this decision .  Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly) .
Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House .  Legislation moving forward .  Bump Stocks will soon be out .  Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law .  Armed guards OK, deterrent !  …
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the  USA  Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers .
Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are somewhat low .  They know they are lying when they say it .  Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS !
The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government … A record in  US  history .  State Department, Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked .  Senate must approve NOW !
The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention .  I backed and campaigned for all of the winners .  They give me credit for one .  Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday .
… have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia .  . just excuse for losing .  The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary .  The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access .
The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out .  Wrong .  I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow .  They are doing a great job and …
Epic crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania tonight .  Thank you !  Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Rick @Saccone4PA18 .  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Join me LIVE in Moon Township, Pennsylvania at 7 : 00pmE .  Great crowd for a #MAGA rally !
The European Union, wonderful countries who treat the  US  very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum .  If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on  US  products going in, we will likewise drop ours .  Big Deficit .  If not, we Tax Cars etc .  FAIR !
In the first hours after hearing that North Korea's leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled & amazed . They couldn't believe it .  But by the following morning the news became FAKE . They said so what, who cares !
North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings .  I believe they will honor that commitment !
Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress .  Big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever) .  Rick will help me a lot .  Also, tough on crime & border .  Loves 2nd A & VETS
Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea .  Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the  US  Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit .  Not fair or sustainable .  It will all work out !
Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea .  President XI told me he appreciates that the  US  is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative .  China continues to be helpful !
Congratulations to Kristian Saucier, a man who has served proudly in the Navy, on your newly found Freedom .  Now you can go out and have the life you deserve !
Chinese President XI XINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea .  President XI told me he appreciates that the  US  is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative .  China continues to be helpful !
We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans .
The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World .  Time and place to be determined .
Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia .  He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship .  Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don't have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia !
That's right @RepBost !  Thank you for your support in helping put America back to work .  It's about JOBS, JOBS, JOBS for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST !
Look forward to being in Pennsylvania tomorrow in support of Rick @Saccone4PA18 .  Big crowd expected in Moon Township .  Vote Rick and see you there !  #MAGA
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !  #MAGA
Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze .  Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time .  Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached .  Meeting being planned !

Great meeting with @Cabinet at the @WhiteHouse today !  #MAGA
Happy #InternationalWomensDay

First Lady Melania Trump to Present the 2018 International Women of Courage Award
Looking forward to 3 : 30  PM  meeting today at the White House .  We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends  and treat us fairly on both trade and the military .
The  US  is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft .  We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years !
China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States .  Our relationship with China has been a very good one, and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with .  We must act soon !
From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars .  Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars .  Bad Policies & Leadership .  Must WIN again !   #MAGA

Great couple, great book !
Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor .  Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely !
Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea .  For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned .  The World is watching and waiting !  May be false hope, but the  US  is ready to go hard in either direction !
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that President Trump has the right to end DACA .  President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn't .  I am waiting for the Dems, they are running for the hills !
Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY .  Problem is, we don't have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course) !
We will see what happens !
We are getting it done - jobs and security !
Total inaction on DACA by Dems .  Where are you ?  A deal can be made !
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House .  Wrong !  People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision .  I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection) .  There is no Chaos, only great Energy !
It's March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA .  Gave them 6 months, they just don't care .  Where are they ?  We are ready to make a deal !
Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November ?  Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win .  Unprecedented .  Bigger than Watergate !  Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling .
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel !  #AMERICA FIRST
… treat our farmers much better .  Highly restrictive .  Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the  US  They have not done what needs to be done .  Millions of people addicted and dying .
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada .  NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for  USA  Massive relocation of companies & jobs .  Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed .  Also, Canada must .  .
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals .  Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the  US  for many years .  Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead .  Sorry, it's time for a change !  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun .  I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People !
If the E . U .  wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on  US  companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the  US  They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there .  Big trade imbalance !
The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our very stupid trade deals and policies .  Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years .  They laugh at what fools our leaders have been .  No more !
Mainstream Media in  US  is being mocked all over the world .  They've gone CRAZY !
Happy National Anthem Day !
Heading to Billy Graham Funeral .  A Special Man !
REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM !
When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart .  We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us .  $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice !
We must protect our country and our workers .  Our steel industry is in bad shape .  IF YOU DON'T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON'T HAVE A COUNTRY !
Eric, we are all with you and your family !  Look forward to seeing you back on T . V .
Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony .  Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch .  Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent !
When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win .  Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don't trade anymore-we win big .  It's easy !
Alex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing DJT was agony for him .  Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch .  You were terrible .  Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent !
Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA !
Manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades !
Jobless claims at a 49 year low !
Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need .  Working together, we will defeat this #OpioidEpidemic . 
Full Opioid Summit :
Consumer Confidence in February Highest Since November 2000
Manufacturing in  US  Expands at Fastest Pace Since May 2004
Unemployment filings are at their lowest level in over 48 years .  Great news for workers and JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !  #MAGA
Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world .  We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer .  We want free, fair and SMART TRADE !
Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House .  Background Checks a big part of conversation .  Gun free zones are proven targets of killers .  After many years, a Bill should emerge .  Respect 2nd Amendment !
It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities .  As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland, we are determined to turn our grief into action .  Full meeting :
Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored .  

We say a prayer for our country :  that all across this land, the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God .
Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival .  From a large tent in Los Angeles, to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium, to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957 …
Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham – an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God's grace .
Why is A . G .  Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse .  Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc .  Isn't the I . G .  an Obama guy ?  Why not use Justice Department lawyers ?  DISGRACEFUL !
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year .  Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country .  MS-13 thugs being hit hard .
I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved .  Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed .  OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY !
The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done, faster than even Ronald Reagan .  We're blown away, said Thomas Binion of Heritage, President Trump is very active, very conservative and very effective .  Huge volume & spectrum of issues .
Big legal win today .   US  judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border .  Now this important project can go forward !
Such a beautiful map, thank you !
@SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved .  Also big help on cutting regs .  I am with him in his re-election all the way !
Texas LC George P .  Bush backed me when it wasn't the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now .  Also, AC Sid Miller has been with me from the beginning, he is Trump's Man in Texas .  Also support Comptroller Glenn Hegar, and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick .
American consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000 … A strong job market is boosting confidence .  The unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low .
I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt .  Gov .  Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton .  They are helping me to Make America Great Again !  Vote early or on March 6th .
WITCH HUNT !
We've seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION … I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he's exercising his power as the President of the  US  I just don't see it .   Judge Ken Starr
I've been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year .  I just don't see the evidence … in terms of the collusion, it's all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have .   Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews
He's got a very good point .  Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs .  Clinton's criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated .  I fully agree with the President on that .  @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show
I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9 : 00  PM  Enjoy !
Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts @FoxNews  So, what else is new .  He is a total phony !
Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump @FoxNews  Of course not, because there is none, and never was .  This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace … and Obama did nothing about Russia !
Dem Memo :  FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC .  Wow !
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST .  Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done .  SO ILLEGAL !
BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS :  93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you ! ) .  50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny ! ) .  79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen) .
Dems are no longer talking DACA !  Out of sight, out of mind, they say .  DACA beneficiaries should not be happy .  Nancy Pelosi truly doesn't care about them .  Republicans stand ready to make a deal !
Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973 .  Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations !
Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania .  @FoxNews .  This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole .  Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP !
Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them .  Very smart people .  Must be firearms adept & have annual training .  Should get yearly bonus .  Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent .  Up to States .
So true Wayne, and Lowest black unemployment in history !
Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done !
Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm and Mrs .  Turnbull of Australia to the @WhiteHouse ! 

🇺🇸🇦🇺Press Conference :
Our nation's motto is IN GOD WE TRUST .  This week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean .  We will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of Billy Graham !  #CPAC2018
We salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance, and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem .  #CPAC2018
After years of rebuilding OTHER nations, we are finally rebuilding OUR nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride !  #CPAC2018
For those of you who are still interested, the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA .  Not a lot of interest on this subject from them !
My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea .  We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country .
CPAC Today !
MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water .  El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem .  We need The Wall !
School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question .  @TuckerCarlson .  Just like so much of CNN, Fake News .  That's why their ratings are so bad !  MSNBC may be worse .
Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials . 

There is nothing more important than protecting our children .  They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver !
On behalf of an entire Nation, CONGRATULATIONS to the  US  Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD !  #GoTeamUSA #Olympics
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11 : 30  AM  to discuss School Safety .   Next week it will be with our Nation's Governors .  It's been many years of all talk, no action .  We'll get it done !
What many people don't understand, or don't want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots .  They love our Country and will do the right thing .                   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health .  Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks !  Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope !
… If a potential sicko shooter knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school .  Cowards won't go there … problem solved .  Must be offensive, defense alone won't work !
… History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes .  It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime .  Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive .  GREAT DETERRENT !
… immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions .  Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this .  Far more assets at much less cost than guards .  A gun free school is a magnet for bad people .  ATTACKS WOULD END !
I never said give teachers guns like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC .  What I said was to look at the possibility of giving concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best .  20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to
I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families .  So much love in the midst of so much pain .  We must not let them down .  We must keep our children safe !  ! 

Full Listening Session :
@FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham .  Our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry .
Yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the Medal of Valor .  #AmericanHeroes
Question :  If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation ?  Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling ?  Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation ?  Ask Jeff Sessions !
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead .  There was nobody like him !  He will be missed by Christians and all religions .  A very special man .
Question :  If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation ?  Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling ?  Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation ?  Ask Jeff Session !
@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks !
So true, thank you !
Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall .  They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway .  Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise !
Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law .  This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses .
… cameras running .  Another False Accusation .  Why doesn't @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me ?  One had her home mortgage paid off .  Only @FoxNews so reported … doesn't fit the Mainstream Media narrative .
A woman I don't know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago .  Never happened !  Who would do this in a public space with live security …
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts .  Total Fake News !
Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new pushed Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary .  Your Original was correct !  Don't let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money !
Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event .  Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House .  You've come a long way Matt !
Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away .  Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially .  Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R's want to fix !
… The President Obama quote just before election .  That's because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn't want to rock the boat .  When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems .
There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections, there's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I'd invite Mr .  Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes .   …
Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more .  We are now starting to win again !
The Faith of Donald Trump, a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read .  Enjoy !
The  US  economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated .  Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving .  The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut !  JOBS, JOBS, JOBS
@MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah .  He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement !
Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election .  So why didn't he do something about Russian meddling ?
Have a great, but very reflective, President's Day !
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes .  The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect .  Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others !
My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500 .  Brian France and the France family are special people .  Enjoy the race !
Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc .  Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot .  Big gain over last 4 weeks .  I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away .  We need more Republicans !
The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN .
If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the  US  then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams .  They are laughing their asses off in Moscow .  Get smart America !
Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election .  But wasn't I a great candidate ?
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer .  The Russian hoax was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did !
Finally, Liddle' Adam Schiff, the leakin' monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election .  He is finally right about something .  Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing .  Thank you Adam !
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1 . 7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation !
General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems .  Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company !
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter .  This is not acceptable .  They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion .  Get back to the basics and make us all proud !
Just like they don't want to solve the DACA problem, why didn't the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration .  Because they didn't want to, and now they just talk !
I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal . 
Rob Goldman
Vice President of Facebook Ads
The Fake News Media never fails .  Hard to ignore this fact from the Vice President of Facebook Ads, Rob Goldman !
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn't want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President .  Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn't know !
Deputy A . G .  Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference :  There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity .  There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election .
Charges Deal Don A Big Win, written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that the Russians had no impact on the election results .  There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign .  She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate .  Case closed .
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida .  Will never forget them, or the evening !
Our entire Nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in Parkland, FL .  To teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger :  We THANK YOU for your courage !
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President .  The results of the election were not impacted .  The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion !
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats … totally abandoned !  Republicans are still working hard .
I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered .  Am also working with Congress on many fronts .
Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida :
… lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants .  Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders .  If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill !
The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe .  @DHSgov says it would be the end of immigration enforcement in America .  It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn't build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa …
In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country .  These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need .
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA !
So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior .  Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem .  Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again !
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott .  We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting .
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting .  No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school .
Today, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America's depleted infrastructure .
As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all .  Proclamation :
Negotiations on DACA have begun .  Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal .  Wouldn't it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle .  This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity !  March 5th .
Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats .  After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more .  Bipartisan, make deal Dems ?
The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year .  See you at #CPAC2018 !
Thank you to Sue Kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends .  We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain !
This will be a big week for Infrastructure .  After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country !
Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD .  This is a true tragedy !
Rep .  Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator .  He is strong & smart, loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country !  Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer !
4 . 2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill … and it will only get better !  We are far ahead of schedule .
So many positive things going on for the  USA  and the Fake News Media just doesn't want to go there .  Same negative stories over and over again !  No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history !     #MAGA
My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system :  fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery .  Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans .
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD .
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do .  The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA .  They only want to use it as a campaign issue .  Vote Republican !
… agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election .  Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don't believe were accurate … he leaked information (corrupt) .  Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews
My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he's been victimized .  He's been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of …
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation .  Some are true and some are false .  Some are old and some are new .  There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone .  Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process ?
According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on Trump to the  US  Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time .  I hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here .  It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP !
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency .  Told them to re-do and send back in proper form !
Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low !
Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond .  This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes .  Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now !
Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military .  Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage .  Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election !
Just signed Bill .  Our Military will now be stronger than ever before .  We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more .  First time this has happened in a long time .  Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS !
Wow !  -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch .  Warner did not want a paper trail on a private meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame .  All tied into Crooked Hillary .
Time to end the visa lottery .  Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans .
As long as we open our eyes to God's grace - and open our hearts to God's love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations .  #NationalPrayerBreakfast
I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1 : 45pm .  Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East .
Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence .  Our currency declares IN GOD WE TRUST .  And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are One Nation Under God .  #NationalPrayerBreakfast
Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington .  Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T . V .  producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there .  Looking forward to seeing all !
The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military .  It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great .  Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill !
Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics !  What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration !
Best wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the @Olympics !  What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION !
NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS !
In the old days, when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up .  Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down .  Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy !
Congratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch .  This achievement, along with @NASA's commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best !
HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan !
Today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it .  Watch here :
We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system .   Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security .
Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery .  If D's oppose this deal, they aren't serious about DACA-they just want open borders .
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken .  @Colts
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson .  This is just one of many such preventable tragedies .  We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST !
Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS !
Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure !
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time .  March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA .  Make a deal !
Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper !  Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information .  Must be stopped !
Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth .  Perhaps that's why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition !
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working .  Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care .  No thanks !
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory !
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina .  Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they've done !
… a tool of anti-Trump political actors .  This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law … The FBI wasn't straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators .  Wall Street Journal
The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath … The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier … the FBI became …
Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them .  Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion !
This memo totally vindicates Trump in probe .  But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on .  Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead) .  This is an American disgrace !
Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain sacred cows .  Other Trump polls are way up also .  So why does the media refuse to write this ?  Oh well, someday !
Today, it was my honor to join the great men and women of @DHSgov, @CustomsBorder, @ICEgov and @USCIS at the  US  Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling, Virginia .  Fact sheet :
Trump the orator outlines the greatness of America to Democrats' disgust
With 3 . 5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS, 2018 is off to great start ! 
✅Unemployment rate at 4 . 1% . 
✅Average earnings up 2 . 9% in the last year . 
✅200,000 new American jobs . 
✅#MAGA🇺🇸
You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team .  Tom Fitton, JW
The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago .  Rank & File are great people !
The Democrats just aren't calling about DACA .  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they'll disappoint you again .  We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems !  March 5th is coming up fast .
Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech .  45 . 6 million people watched, the highest number in history .  @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11 . 7 million people tuning in .  Delivered from the heart !
March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA .  They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing .  Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW !
Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party .  Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats .  NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL !  Need more Republicans in ‘18 .
Join me live for the #SOTU
Congratulations to America's new Secretary of @HHSGov, Alex Azar !
Our economy is better than it has been in many decades .  Businesses are coming back to America like never before .  Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA .  Unemployment is nearing record lows .  We are on the right track !
Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED !
Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military .  They are only interested in Obstruction !
I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons :  (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem .  (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it !
Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today .  Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders .  We will not allow the Taliban to win !
On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide .  We pledge with all of our might and resolve :  Never Again !
Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL .  Must also end loophole of catch & release and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons .
Thank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF !  #Davos2018
DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin' Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration !
Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos, Switzerland .  Speech on America's economic revival was well received .  Many of the people I met will be investing in the  USA  !  #MAGA
Join me live at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland !  #WEF18
Great bilateral meeting with President @Alain_Berset of the Swiss Confederation - as we continue to strengthen our great friendship .  Such an honor to be in Switzerland !  #WEF18
It was an honor to meet with Republic of Rwanda President Paul Kagame this morning in Davos, Switzerland .  Many great discussions !  #WEF18
Will be interviewed on  @SquawkCNBC by @JoeSquawk coming up at 6 : 00amE from Davos, Switzerland .  Enjoy !  #WEF18
Today, Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nation's eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential .
Very productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos, Switzerland !  #WEF18
Great bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom, affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities .  #WEF18
Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing .  Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better … Our country is finally WINNING again !
It was my great honor to welcome Mayor's from across America to the WH .  My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best .  Together, we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity !
Earlier today, I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday's shooting at Marshall County High School .  My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery .  We are with you !
Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America .  There has never been anything like it .  Now Disney, J . P .  Morgan Chase and many others .  Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again .  Long way to go !  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs !
Cryin' Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA .  We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people !
Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok ?   Blaming Samsung !
Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done .  Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us !
Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying … with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security .  The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer !
In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time .  Wow !
In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI says it is now missing five months worth of lovers Strzok - Page texts, perhaps 50,000, all in prime time .  Wow !
Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees :  Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone :  Trump wins again … Schumer and Dems caved … gambled and lost .  Thank you for your honesty Jim !
Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown .  Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security .  Should be able to get there .  See you at the negotiating table !
End the Democrats Obstruction !
Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base .  They don't want to do it but are powerless !
The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens .  Not good !
Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an A-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements .  Working hard !
Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border .  The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked .  If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C . R . 's !
Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now !
The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length .  The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME !
Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election .  Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more .  Big 2018 !
Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March .  Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months .  Lowest female unemployment in 18 years !
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration .  Can't let that happen !
#AMERICA FIRST !
For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60 .  That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election !  We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans !
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present .  #DemocratShutdown
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border .  They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead .  #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess !
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border .  Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy .
Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan .  Making progress - four week extension would be best !
Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection .  This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election .  I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first !
Today, I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life !  You are living witnesses of this year's March for Life theme :  #LoveSavesLives .
Shutting down the government is a very serious thing .  People die, accidents happen .  I don't know how I would vote right now on a CR, OK ? 
Sen .  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif)
@WhiteHouse Briefing with Director Marc Short and Director Mick Mulvaney …
Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives .  Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders .  Shutdown coming ?  We need more Republican victories in 2018 !
House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight .  So important for our country - our Military needs it !
AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big, dreams bigger, and always reaches for the stars .  YOU are the ones who will shape America's destiny .  YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity .  And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !  #MAGA
Departing Pittsburgh now, where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers, and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before !
A government shutdown will be devastating to our military … something the Dems care very little about !
CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension !
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country .  We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world .  If there is no Wall, there is no Deal !
Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13) .  Rick is a great guy .  We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda !
… The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the  US  The $20 billion dollar Wall is peanuts compared to what Mexico makes from the  US  NAFTA is a bad joke !
The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it .  Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water …
ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more !  Together there is nothing we can't overcome--even a very biased media .  We ARE Making America Great Again !
Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of !
And the FAKE NEWS winners are …
Main Street is BACK !  Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS .
During the campaign, I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country .  I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers !
I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States .  Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS .  Huge win for American workers and the USA !
Today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of Congress' highest civilian honor to our friend, and true AMERICAN HERO, Bob Dole .  #CongressionalGoldMedal
Eric Trump on @foxandfriends  now !
… we need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based .
New report from DOJ & DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born .  We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms …
Today, it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse !
President Donald J .  Trump Proclaims January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day
Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded .  Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled .  Thank you, and it will get even (much) better !  @FoxNews
90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative -and much of it contrived ! @foxandfriends
Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative .  The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the Dems .  Public gets it !
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security .  The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever .  We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now !  No more dangerous Lottery .
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country !
Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting .  Deals can't get made when there is no trust !  Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military .
… to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do .  My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
Statement by me last night in Florida :  Honestly, I don't think the Democrats want to make a deal .  They talk about DACA, but they don't want to help .  . We are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don't want to .  They don't want security at the border, they don't want …
… big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible (among many other things) .  President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama, and reversed our economic decline .  Thank you Stuart Varney .   @foxandfriends
President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy .  Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers .  Most explosive Stock Market rally that we've seen in modern times .  18,000 to 26,000 from Election, and grounded in profitability and growth .  All Trump, not 0 …
I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT .  No more Lotteries !  #AMERICA FIRST
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don't really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military .
… and they knew exactly what I said and meant .  They just wanted a story .  FAKE NEWS !
The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un (of N .  Korea) .  Obviously I didn't say that .  I said I'd have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un, a big difference .  Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters …
So much Fake News is being reported .  They don't even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong .  They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information .  The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election !
I don't believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA .  They are all talk and no action .  This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have .  Too bad !
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market .  Chrysler coming back to  US  (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees .  If Dems won in November, Market would have TANKED !  It was headed for disaster .
AMERICA FIRST !
The Democrats are all talk and no action .  They are doing nothing to fix DACA .  Great opportunity missed .  Too bad !
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market .  Jobs are coming back to America .  Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow .  Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing .  American business is hot again !
Today, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr . , Federal Holiday .  I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr .  King's life and legacy .
Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country .  Never said take them out .  Made up by Dems .  I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians .  Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust !
Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA .  Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST !
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used .  What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA !
… Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards .  The Dems will threaten shutdown, but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most .  Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
… countries which are doing badly .  I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level .  I want safety and security for our people .  I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs .  I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund …
The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards .  Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime …
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for peanuts, only to build a new one in an off location for 1 . 2 billion dollars .  Bad deal .  Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO !
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process .  It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans .  We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain .  USA !
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization .  Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal .  She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first !
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend .  Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision .  The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence .  Plenty of more to follow !
More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform :  Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to  US  employees !
Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history .  All business is just at the beginning of something really special !
Thank you Adam Levine, The Federalist, in interview on @foxandfriends  Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen .
Yesterday, I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H . R .  2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country .  Together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States !
Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS & JOBS ACT !
With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land .  We need it !  Get smart !
45 year low in illegal immigration this year .  @foxandfriends
House votes on controversial FISA ACT today .  This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others ?
In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is Excellent or Good .  That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll .
Disproven and paid for by Democrats Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign .  Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election ?  @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians ?  Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers ?  Where are Crooked Hillary Emails ?   What a mess !
Good news :  Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUV's a year and employ 4000 people .  Companies are coming back to the  US  in a very big way .  Congratulations Alabama !
Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest !  Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1 . 6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy !
The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval .  The safety and security of our country is #1 !
Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States !  Joint press conference :
I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country .  2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead .  Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN !
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues .  There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes .  Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing .  Republicans should finally take control !
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace .  Must have tough Primary !
It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts .
@ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers, on behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American's SAFE .  Everyone is so grateful ! 
#LawEnforcementAppreciationDay
President @realDonaldTrump
Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy !  Couldn't agree w/you more .  TOGETHER, we are #MAGA🇺🇸
As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval .
Today, it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life .  We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve !
